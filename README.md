# MSDS692_S41_Data_Science_Practicum1
This repository contains my practicum project for the Regis University MSDS program. It includes datasets, notebooks, and scripts developed for building and analyzing machine learning models, data preprocessing, visualization, and report generation as part of the Data Science Practicum I course.

## Repository Preview:

* Sample dataset is provided under "df_sample.csv"
* The "requirements.txt" has all requirements to run codes.
* "Results" files has html files for topic visualization and other key results like sentiment are available.
* The saved models for sentiment analysis are available in "Models"
* "Key Data Features" consists of all important data from our analysis like defects_topics.csv
* Code files:

       1)"CollectingScraped_data.ipynb" used to get data from scrapping, here from walmart

       2) Merging_the_data.ipynb is for combining scraped data and avaiable data. And A bit of data preprocessing is in it.
 
       3)  "defects_detection.ipynb" has complete analysis.
