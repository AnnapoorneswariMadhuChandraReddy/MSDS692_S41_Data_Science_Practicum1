It was hard to wrap my head around a hero who is six foot eleven tall!  No pun intended.  Just didn't work for me and I won't be buying the rest of the series.,3.0
"Damn, I enjoyed the blurb so much I'm giving it a premature, provisional 5 Stars.I definitely want to know how to write a threatening introduction. (Fair warning: If there are no practical techniques offered by PPIII, I'm going to revise my review to a snarling, 1-star hate-fest that states, in part, his bow tie must've cut off circulation to his brain, etc.)Thank you for providing a timely how-to on a vexing issue that the self-published face today. (Unless you haven't. In which case, I'll be opening a can of verbal whoop-ass on you, buster.)",5.0
I enjoyed the storyline but I believe that it could have been better. The concept for this series had huge potential but I think the quick and racy sex scenes took over. I hope the second book in the series will be more to do with the storyline concept.,4.0
"Received book free of charge from the Author for an honest review.Ethan has been plagued with dreams of his colleague, David. Not just everyday regular dreams either. Erotic dreams that are keeping him on edge. David has been attracted to Ethan for awhile and has been biding his time. That is until they find themselves stranded and he notices the heated looks being sent his way. David is determined to loosen Ethan up, if he will let him. Ethan is nervous, but he doesn't fight the attraction he feels for David.It's not about sexual orientation it's about the touch of another person. Neither man is gay, but what they find together is beautiful and something worth exploring.Let's just say that these two men bring out the beast in the other and WOW it was HOT!! Then when a third was brought in it just got that much hotter. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it for anyone who likes to read graphic erotica.Yep, I'm giving it 5 HOT Stars!!!",5.0
"A fast-paced, sexy, emotional and sometimes tender romp through the damaged psyche of two men who complement each other through their own flaws and deep desires.Dominic Scotto is heartbroken, having walked in on his lover with another man. A man he'd thought was out of his boyfriend Wes' life for good. Then things get even worse. He's knocked unconscious and wakes up bound to a chair with what looks a psychopath ready to carve him up.Smoke is an assassin--a very well-placed, well-respected assassin, but still a killer. And Dominic is his next target. Smoke wants some answers from Dominic about his father's empire and he's no averse to using violence and coercion to get them. But the son of the father has nothing to give. Instead he has to watch as he's slowly cut and sliced by Smoke in his efforts to draw out what he wants to know.Then things get a little...awkward. Smoke begins to realize that Dominic isn't all that averse to the torture he's inflicting, and in fact, it's having quite an effect on the young man. From that point on, things spiral out of control, certainly out of Smoke's as he struggles to come to terms with the conflicting feelings he has for Dominic.It's gritty, sexy and violent in some parts, as the two men face each other down, both with their own needs and desires, hot passion flaring and taking over as the walls each have built around themselves come tumbling down.The book is written well, the characters fleshed out so that you get to understand them and what makes them tick. If you fancy a bit of violence, cruelty, family drama and justice, ending with the culmination of these two men finding each other again, then you'll love this story.Reviewed by Susan Mac Nicolfor TheRomanceReviews.com",3.0
Wonderful writing. Excellent plots. I liked all the characters in all the books. I would recommend this book to friends. I had a hard time with the last book. I am not into Kinky sex. Some parts were a bit much!,5.0
"I am a long-time reader of Lora Leigh's books, and this one was pretty good.  The plot line was predictable but I liked the interaction between Sax and Marey.  However, there is one aspect of this author's writing that I really get tired of, and that is her over-use of phrases such as ""breathed out roughly"", ""spoke roughly"", ""breathed in roughly"", ""whispered roughly"";  please, Ms. Leigh, be aware that when one word is used over and over again in books, ad nauseum, it gets really old fast!  In this particular book, I counted at least 6 times when these types of phrases were used.",3.0
"I learned about Glenn Soucy on Twitter & decided to purchase his book series.  I was skeptical at first, wondering if I would enjoy this genre.  Glenn does a good job keeping the story fresh and moving.  His character development is sound.  There are a few e-book formatting issues, but I can live with those.  Overall, I'd say Glenn is a good writer.",4.0
"I enjoy reading young adult novels even if I'm older than the perfect reader, so I was very happy when I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my review. I must admit that after a great introduction where you could get an introduction to the setting and the main character, the first chapters were a little bit difficult to read because of the language and slow events but the characters are well described and after the awkward scene of love of first sight, the novel really starts engaging the reader.The author did a great job in creating a young, strong and likable character as Thera who starts a personal journey and discovers her real powers to fight evil and lethal enemies.One of the elements I really loved was how the nature is linked to the characters: the force, the forest talking to Thera and trying to help and warn, the animal spirits... I think it was a great way to make readers thinking about our impact to the Earth and what can we do to improve the world around us.I also loved the relationship between the characters,and I always appreciate when in a Y/A novel young girls have the power to change and fight instead of just being in love or saved by their true love.I hope the sequel will be published soon to read more about Thera and the Elanraigh world as the ending arrived when I was totally enjoying the story.I'd recommend this book to everyone who loves a well written novel about magic, love, adventure and nature.",4.0
"Renee Rose has a gift when it comes to writing historical romance.  She can paint a picture that you can readily see in your mind's eye and gives you a glimpse of how things used to be.  You feel as if you are there experiencing what her characters are going through and that leads to an emotional connection.  This is a wonderful story with a strong plot and stronger characters.I loved the character of Jean-Claude, I think he was my favorite in this story.  He is surely an alpha man but there is such warmth and caring which is a huge part of his character. Corinne is surely a lucky woman.  There is some great romance and some hot sex with some well deserved discipline applied as necessary.  Well done Ms. Rose and I am sure this is one I will read again.I received this book from Stormy Night Publications as an Advanced Reader Copy. Hmmmm, I don't know why my name was changed to Amazon Customer, sheesh, but I have changed it back to SH!",5.0

"Soulphisticated Ladies Episode 1by Jaha KnightThanks to Jaha Knight for the copy to review today.Soulphisticated Ladies is a book about all the things us women go through. Issues such as men, money, love and power.This book is based on a group of female friends who have different personalities, and trying to make it in this world.The girls are named Selah, Gennifer, Vashti, and Moria.  Selah a strong character, seems to be worried about the competition in her job from the so called Slithers.That would be Cin and her group of employees are known as the Slitherers , reminds me of Harry Potter. She is a sneaky manipulative woman with a team of snakes. They will try anythingto get to success, from stealing ideas of other agency's and Selah was the team Devine. They got things by working hard and working together.Then you have Moria who is married with kids, and by that you know right away she must be stressed with caring for kids and taking care of the household.Also she has in mind of having more kids. However it seems as her husband may be sleeping around. Vashti seems to be a great big snoop and able to catch a guys lies instantly. After her past experience with her ex, she was very well in figuring out a guy who is never telling the truth. Though Gennifer and Vashti tried to bring them more together with all their attempts to keep them together and not to allow Sloan, husband of Moria to fall for someone else. Unfortunately Vashti had some secrets she held in about sleeping with Sloan and didn't want her friends to know about it as well. Though it was before Sloan knew Vashit was friends with Moria at the time.In away to me Gennifer is like the kind trusted person of the group, always helping out. To continue, as the episode goes on, Gennifer and Vashti start digging deeper finding out that Sloan was doing more then paying rent for this girl he was sleeping with, but a bill for each Tuesday get together at the Masquerade Inn.Well that is most of the story and I rather not go and ruin it for all of you, but lets just say it gets juicy, page by page.So these girls do have a lot of baggage and things going on that happens in a typical life of many women. Its tough sometimes to juggle work, men and having time for yourself. This is only part one so, you can tell there is more drama to come. When it ends you will be wanting more! The fight that goes on and so much intense, I felt like I was watching a lifetime movie in a book.",5.0

"I devoured this book - the Prologue (see below) pulled me in and I just had to finish the book. The author did a great job of keeping you right on the edge of your seat.Tia is Melissa's daughter, and she was raised by Melissa and Gracie after her father was killed in Afghanistan on the day she was born.  This family was dysfunctional from the start.  Melissa retreated into her own world and Gracie raised Melissa like she was her own child for the first couple of years.  I use the phrase ""like her own chld"" loosely here as I don't know any mother who would put their child through what these two did.  Gracie was the true criminal here while Melissa's crime was just being negligent and keeping her eyes closed to what was going on.After Tia is arrested, she refuses to talk to anyone. A very caring (and clever) Dr. Eaton or  ""psycho-doc"" as she calls him, gets her to trust him and convinces her to start keeping a journal.  She documents her life through her birthdays and what happens each year.  She finally reaches a point though, that she  can't remember what happened, or just refuses to remember what happened.  She lets Dr. Eaton read her journal - I think because it is all too painful for her to say out loud - but she wants someone to know.Between her journal writings and conversations that Melissa has with her also dysfunctional mother Louise, you begin to learn about Tia's life.  At times it is almost too painful to read, but I couldn't put it down.  The tension was just enough to keep me riveted.I really liked how the author resolved the book and brought some lost souls together in the end.",5.0
"Star Rating: 4.5 starsHeat Rating: HOT HOT&#34;..you should take comfort in the fact that this isn't really your decision at all.  Love finds you.  It's not the other way around.  The only choice you really have is whether or not you want to be found.&#34;Pieces of Perfect by Elizabeth Hayley had me from the first chapter!  I had no idea what I was in for reading this book but I was pleasantly surprised how much I LOVED this story!  You know from the blurb that this is going to be a love triangle, which to be honest, isn't my favorite plot lines, and I ate up every bite of this scrumptious book!Pieces of Perfect was HOT (right from the beginning) but it also made you stop and think about what you would do in Lily's shoes.  Sometimes love isn't cut and dry, sometimes you find yourself facing really tough choices and there is no right or wrong answer.  This book really was well done and gave the reader a lot to think about.  Elizabeth Hayley did a great job breathing life into Lily, Max and Adam's stories and I never could bring myself to pick a &#34;team&#34; I fell in love with both of them.My emotions were all over this place with this one, I was mad, happy, frustrated, shocked, heart broken and then satisfied.  Pieces of Perfect is one of the best love triangle books I have read, it handled things realistically and let the reader get inside what Lily was going through without her coming off like a heartless and cold person.Elizabeth Hayley make quite the writing team! I am addicted to this story and I really hope we get more from these three characters in the future (but if we don't I am OK with that too).  Pieces of Perfect is definitely a story that will be sticking with me for days to come.  I HIGHLY recommend this book, it will get you thinking about life, love and airports.  Go 1-click and enjoy this emotional ride with Lily this weekend.",4.0

"Were to begin? I think that the only way to explain what I felt with this hook is to be honest. A month ago a friend recommend me ""Fringe"", the tv series, you know that series, right? It's about impossible things turning possible. And one of this crazy but intriguing possibilities are parallel universes.I'm simply in love with this matter, it makes me think, makes me want to understand things that are beyond reality. That's the reason I loved this book. ""Parallel"" was everything I expected and much, much more.There are so many questions I would like to ask the author, Claudia, now that I have read the book but I think I'm just going to wait for the second part, I believe it's going to be as exciting, fun and clever as this book.Don't hesitate, if you have the opportunity just buy it. I mean, I read this book really fast, I couldn't and, to be honest, wouldn't stop turning pages. Is not only the twists but the fact that, even if you are not a fan of science, the plot is not very complicated and the ending... I wish I could tell you more but you need to read it, seriously.",4.0
"Ginger Marcinkowski's stories about buttons that reveal family memories is my first read from this fine author.  I was immediately drawn into the Polk family saga and recalled the ""buttons"" in my own life.  Both of my grandmothers saved buttons in lovely old tins, as well as an elderly next door neighbor lady that I visited often.  How I loved going through those buttons and admiring the sparkly ones mostly, but bright colors and odd shapes piqued my imagination over and over.  I wonder if all my questions about these peculiar items were a nuisance to their collectors.Back to the story at hand, John Polk's family was ordinary, in that their ups and downs, dreams, tragedies, and faith in God were much like other families.  The subtle difference was the loving Christian characterization of John Polk.  I felt like part of the family around the blazing fire listening to John reveal memories through a button picked from an old tin box by one of his two daughters, grandchildren or himself.John's daughters were different from each other in their reactions to John's revelations.  Maureen, the oldest, displayed boredom with indifference.  Carol, the youngest, more like her gentle mother Ellen, was always caught up in the story and grasped the value of God's ultimate message.  Maureen was becoming rebellious in her identity and a worry to her parents.In fact, John had displayed rebellion in his youth that led to a drunken experience ending in tragedy; ultimately realizing the need for God's love and forgiveness in his life.  This story began in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, Canada 1956 - nostalgic to my own years of being a teen and related easily to the years that followed to 1997 when this story concluded in a poignant intention of carrying on this family tradition.When I began reading this sweet novella, I was unaware that it is a sequel to Ms Marcinkowski's Run, River Currents.  Wishing I had read it before The Button Legacy, I intend to read Ginger Marcinkowski's Run, River Currents soon.  The character of John's granddaughter, Emily, was bittersweet and the favorite of her ""Grampy"" John.  Emily Evans, being the daughter of Maureen, might have followed in her mother's footsteps; however Grampy John was wise in the Lord, and effective in teaching a lesson of trust.Rich and deep in meaning of God's love are Ginger Marcinkowski's words - so compelling in faith and knowledge of God's Word.  The humor is addictive, causing giggles so hard my bed shook.  The button stories gather personal emotions of happiness and tears.  How our lives parallel our neighbors as well as in the generations before us are awesome and amazing to witness God's touch throughout.  Well done, Ms Marcinkowski.  Thank you for writing loud words of joyful noise.I received a free kindle copy of this story from Cross Focused Reviews in exchange for my honest review.",5.0
"First let me say that I am a Maureen Smith fan. And I faithfully stalked her website and FB page religiously. So, what a WONDERFUL surprise it was to see Seducing... was FINALLY available.I was not sure that I was going to like where Ms. Smith would go with Manning and Taylor's story; especially after 20years being apart. But, the way she explained their separate lives in detail helped with them coming together. I especially enjoyed Manning. Whew! He was so sexy and sinful...with His brilliant mind. I enjoyed seeing an author who was able to show an intelligent, strong Black man, who was able to be professional when he needed to be. And, able to turn it off and show his ""street cred"" too when hanging with his boyz and brothers. I also like the fact that Taylor was a smart, professional woman, with an inner freak waiting to come out- with Manning. (No more Tame Taylor!) I loved reading about the sights and sounds of Atlanta and Paris, as well as laughing at the impromptu step show at the bar-be-que. These descriptions showed a true knowledge of what was going on, or either some studying. Some of the conversations took me back to my college days. What great fun! I loved the strong bond and love that Manning and Taylor had for one another. He truly loved her like a goddess.I thoroughly enjoy Ms. Smith's writing because she ALWAYS shows strong men and women of color; along with positive family relationships. Don't get me wrong, there is always drama and secrets. But, there is also love, loyalty, and forgiveness. I always fond of her including the other characters from previous books, and how she incorporates them all together nicely. Great job Ms. Smith!!! I am truly looking forward to the next book with the Wolf Pack. Montana.... Mr. Sexy, sax Jazz player. Yummy!!",5.0

"I bought this book because I read &#34;Why Her&#34;, &#34;Why Me&#34;, and &#34;Double Dose&#34;! Those books were so good that I'm thinking anything this author writes has to be good. The book started off great. It left off where &#34;Why Her&#34; series stopped but as I was reading other characters appeared that wasn't in the other books. I was so confused that I stopped reading the book. Come to find out those characters were from another series &#34;Salty&#34;. It's ok to put characters in your book from other books u wrote but don't make it confusing to the people that haven't read the series. I really wish I can get my money back cause I feel like I'm being bullied into buying Salty series. In other words &#34;Why Him&#34; is a continuation from the &#34;Salty&#34; series!!!

"Eli Gaither runs the family business of salvaging valuable materials from old houses, polishing them up and selling them for a profit.  He is a divorced man in his 40&#8217;s with three basically grown children and a witch for an ex-wife.  He is also gay, well I think he labels himself as bi.  His youngest son is in high school and recently just shown up at his door.  He was caught with another boy having sex and his mother threw him out.  He had nowhere to go but his dad&#8217;s, whom he has only spoken to a few times since the divorce, which was the boy&#8217;s choice.Just as Eli is trying to deal with his quiet life now being tossed around by the addition of his son, he gets a call saying that Oscar is coming to see him.  Oscar is a young gay man who is comfortable with his sexuality and is an interior designer.  They met one day when Oscar went to Eli&#8217;s store to purchase some items for the company.  Being warned that Eli doesn&#8217;t like weak shy people, Oscar went in with flair.  This led to a night of sex at a hotel, where Eli left early morning and did something he will regret forever.This story takes us on their journey, overcoming the age difference, the miles between their prospective homes, and the overriding need for passion that they have for each other.  Eli is going to have to deal with not having the quiet life of a hermit any more, he is going to have to face the love for Oscar, the roles of being an active father to a son who hated him for the divorce and the ex-wife who would rather save her reputation with the church than deal with the issues at hand.  We learn his secrets from his past life and realize looks aren&#8217;t everything.Oscar is dealing with his boss who he adores being ill, we never find out what is the disease but we know it takes a toll on Oscar.  Also how is he going to convince Eli age is only a number and help him overcome his fears?While I found this book to have some editing problems, I didn&#8217;t feel it was worthy of taking a star away in the ratings.  I just found so many questions unanswered and directions that were not explained that I had a hard time really investing in the story.  The character development was good to a point, but I never felt I was able to really understand their emotions and story.  The discussion of their sex scenes was hot, but I also felt they were raw and lacked real intimacy. It felt more like two animals going at each other than showing us the love we were lead to believe.  I would recommend this book if you were into a quick read with no real investment, then you have a hit.  If you wanted something that would melt your heart and stay with you for a while, I am not sure you will find it here.Reviewed by Tbird for Crystal&#8217;s Many Reviewers*Copy provided for honest review*",3.0

This is one of those short reads you can do in a few hours. Even with the short amount of time that we have to know the characters they draw you in. Ceri goes to meet her ex-husband Russell to discuss visitation rights for their daughter...at least that's what she's led to believe. While waiting to go up to his office she runs into to her ex-fiancee who she still has feelings for. Jason and his dad need to discuss his brother Peter with Ceri's ex-husband and things get real interesting once everyone is in place. Russell is using a drug that has been banned and with that drug you now have a new outbreak of zombies. The race for safety is afoot and you just have to read the final outcome.I rated this four out of five only because I would have liked just a little more information on if the others from the elevator made it to safety. A great book to get you in the mood for some Halloween scare.(less),4.0

"***I did received this book in exchange for a review.***Greg James has done it again. He's a phenomenal author who guarantees to take you on a journey. I've had the pleasure of reading his Vetala Cycle books under the pen name G.R. Yeates. His words create a poetic atmosphere that captures you and doesn't let go. He brings you in with such vivid imagery that as you read you see the world he creates playing in your mind like a movie.The Sword of Sighs was such a book. From the cover of the book, to the synopsis, to the prologue, he grabbed a hold of me and didn't let go. Nice! The story had a Lord of the Rings feel to it in that the story was a grand and epic adventure. I've read stories before where there's action and adventure but none to the scale of what James created with The Sword of Sighs.I am happy to know that this book is part of a series as I would like to know more about Sarah's life in our world. I would like to know how come she was the one chosen for this quest and why. I would like to know how her story continues in the world of Seythe.I have to say that while this is a young adult fantasy, it certainly is different than any I've read. Some young adult fantasy I've read have the lead female character in love with her male counterpart. This is usually what defines her, not the fact that she has the potential to become something greater. This is certainly not the case with Sarah Bean. We see her grow as a person through out the story and start becoming who she was chosen to be.Do I recommend this book? Heck yeah I do!

"Review copyThose were the days.  Heading to the drive in on a Friday night.  If you were lucky, it was with the girl with whom you were hoping to get past second base.  But then, it could be just as much fun with your friends.  Maybe with one or two of you in the trunk to save the admission fee.The Orbit Drive-In off I-45 is the largest Drive-In in Texas with space for four-thousand cars.  With two or more occupants per car, that makes The Orbit bigger than many small Texas towns.The Orbit shows &#34;B-string and basement-budget pictures.  A lot of them made with little more than a Kodak, some spit and a prayer.  And if you've watched enough of this stuff, you develop a taste for it, sort of like learning to like sauerkraut.&#34;Lansdale is a skilled writer who creates real people and then places them in real bad situations.  Even when those situations are themselves like a B-string movie.  And therein lies the charm of The Drive-In.The Drive-In uses a familiar plot device where you take a diverse group of people and place them in a locked environment where there's no way out.  Think Stephen King's Under the Dome.  Although Landale's work pre-dates King's novel by some 20 years  they both deal with the lengths people will go just to survive.Populated with some truly bizarre characters like The Popcorn King and a group of religious cannibals, The Drive-In is all the fun of those tacky B-movies from the golden age of the drive-in.  Roger Corman would be proud.First published in 1988, The Drive-In is now available as an ebook, in a variety of formats, from the folks at Crossroad Press.  Also available are two sequels in the series.If you've never read The Drive-In, I can recommend this one for a fast, fun read.",5.0
"The book, as a whole, was capable of holding your interest.

Dance is one way where children can express themselves in a very powerful way.

This book is a must have for anyone involved in a blended family in any way. Children can learn from this book as well as adults can.

No where near as creative or funny as the real ones I have seen so I gave up on the book, and assigned it one star as is my practice with books that I start reading and do not finish.Just did not trip my trigger.",1.0
"I enjoyed this book.  We have a single woman who is a therapist by day, waiting to take the clinicals, and a Burlesque Dancer at night.  People she works with keep showing up dead.  The action is fast paced and was easy read.  Her words were descriptive and I enjoyed it.  The only thing that threw me was being left with a cliffhanger and knowing the next book in the series is not due until 2014.  By then I may have to read it again, lol.",4.0

"4.9 STARSMy Opinion:Riley was hired, by his uncle Frank, as the security guy for Austin and his niece Olivia.Frank and his 'girlfriend' are the bad guys here - we already know that from reading Broken Ever After.They want Riley to get close to Liv so that they can somehow get the codes for all her inherited bank accounts. They think they deserve the money more than her.But when Riley finds out what they're really planning for Olivia it's almost too late.He started falling for her the first time he saw her. This young girl - who was having an affair with her teacher.But said teacher hurt Liv - mostly because Riley helped in causing those situations as part of his uncle's plan. But it was never his intention to hurt Olivia.....Will there be a chance for Riley and Olivia? Or does she still want to be with the teacher-guy??I'm not telling you that of course&#9786;I don't want to spoil your reading pleasure &#9786; and - we don't really find out anything anyway......we all read Broken Ever After - so we know how it all ends - BUT it's not really ending yet - there will be more coming &#9786;__________________________________I ENJOYED THE BOOK A LOTIt was exciting, sexy, funny.......It was soooo short though :(But I was reallllly happy to read Riley's POV - we really needed to see what his motivation was behind this whole thing. It helped to understand him. He didn't appear all that nice in Broken Ever After....but now we love him - but we also loved Jamie in BEA :( so - who do we want Liv to end up with??? Can we have both??? YES PLEASE NATALIE!!! Let's make this a m&eacute;nage-relationship &#9786;Everybody who read & loved Broken Ever After needs to read this novella!!!There were so many questions left unanswered in BEA - and there still are - but this book really helps us to surive the time until we can get our hands on book #2 &#9786;Please hurry up Natalie - I need to know what will happen!!",5.0

"(Note: This short story was gifted to me through Amazon by the author, Annie Zhu, in exchange for an honest review. She sweetened the pot by saying she'd enjoyed my review ofGone Girl, which I regard as improbable since less than a handful of people have judged that offering ""useful."" OK, so I'm easily bought. But thank you, Annie, just the same.)""I wanted to go home instead of being out there pretending that I cared. I wished I cared instead of pretending that I did."" - The anonymous protagonist of LOVE SANDWICHES while handing out baloney-on-white to the urban homelessSince the Annie Zhu has a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, I tend to think - though I may be horribly wrong - that LOVE SANDWICHES is perhaps the author's trial literary balloon sent aloft in the fickle winds of the buying masses. A first public tryout of her writing skills, if you will.I have to admit that I didn't see much eyebrow-raising substance in LOVE SANDWICHES, but that may be due to the fact that I'm an almost-64-year old man now out of touch with the mindset of a very much younger woman fictionally created by another (presumably) young woman. Well, perhaps I was never in touch with such.However, I do very much admire the clarity and perceptivity Annie displays when describing characters, situations, feelings, and dialogue. If she could keep it going for a full-length novel with a substantive plot, I'd be disposed to read it.Four stars, then, for the potential in Annie's talent. Five stars is something to which she can and should aspire.",4.0
"I loved Kale, I loved how much the boy needed his woman, &#34;not wanting to stop, I grasped her waist an pushed her back against the couch. &#34;We'll talk after, babe.

"I was happy to see the way the series ended and to get a glimpse into the future as to what happened in their lives.  While there wasn't as much action/suspense in this book, it was still enjoyable.  For me, it was Jack who carried the series.  I loved that he was mature, caring, sexy, as well as moral and ethical.  The positive spin he put on events was really appreciated.  It would be great it you could spin off some of the other characters for their own books (Brandon, Jayne, Anthony) so I could still have a connection with Jack.  Thanks for creating such a wonderful character.  Hope there are more to come.",4.0

"This book started out as interesting but quickly descended to trash.  The hero, I guess, became unlikeable.  I guess the second main character was a woman deserting because of fear of death who was captured and turned into a cyborg.  Kindle is helpful because it tells you how much I read.

"I received Children of No One as a review copy from Netgally via the publisher Darkfuse in exchange for an honest review.I &lt;3 Nicole. She's smart, sweet and just the right amount of quirky that is a must in an author. She does however make me jump for joy when I get to read one of her stories. Her previous book I've enjoyed for it's superb uniqueness not an easy thing to do now a days. Everything is all ohhh vampires are popular people will want to read nothing but vampire books. Sigh publishers you know nothing. Flogging a dead horse is kinda pointless. Enjoy then leave it alone.Indie however like Nicole gives me what I enjoy uniqueness, difference and me sitting with the most peculiar expression on my face going what is Nicole on!!!!!! Then I crap my pants in terror. Children of No One is just so damn scary in one aspect because of the possibility/probability of it being possible. Children taken when young and brainwashed that angles bring them manna from heaven. Follow the sound of the bell and you get to eat the angels will not help you so good luck oh yes and they are locked in a maze with no sunlight because it's art. Least that's what Krieg and Mr. No One think. I think they're out of they're freaking minds not to mention sadists. The scary as hell look at sadism, darkness of the mind and soul makes me never want to get on Nicole's bad side I highly suspect she'd know how to kill me and make my body disappear for good.Children of No One is Nicole's debut novella, I so look forward to a full length novel from her. Not sure if it's ever to come she has mastered the short for sure.The story opens with two brothers arguing over light, remembering no you don't yes I do. A very wealthy individual who wishes to see this art comes into the picture. Then mind games begin, the back and forth who's with who, what is real, what isn't makes the readers head spin.I loved the story. It takes a supernatural twist which I have to be honest I didn't love. Liked, enjoyed yes but wanted the focus to be on the boys, the maze tell me more tell me everything. Within fewer pages than many authors and a hand full of characters Nicole can take you on a ride that will seriously haunt you.  If you haven't experienced the chill, the thrill that is Nicole Cushing you are missing out in a major way. Read it, read it now. I shouldn't be the only one sucked in.",4.0

"Long For Me is one of the most emotional books I have read by Shiloh Walker. With the connections between the different characters in this Secrets and Shadows Series, it reminded me of how the Hunters Series was so all connected. However, this one story of Guy and Christina reminds me of the Grimm&#8217;s Circle Series, so much anguish and heartbreak to overcome. The longing and wishing, the friend to soul mate were so well expressed in this story. Beautifully written, heart wrenching at times, but just beautiful. How the past, in this case parental issue, overshadow and affect the present were so brilliantly done. What a way Ms. Walker has of writing this kind of story. The story pulled me in and held me until Christine finally made her choice for the future with Guy.  I thought Break For Me was great but this is even better. If I could, I would give it 6 stars.Copy provided by NetGalley for an honest review.",5.0

"&#8220;The Ribbon Tier&#8221; is a very dark, powerful work of fiction. It is a difficult read, not because of a complex plot, but because it begins in a very mysterious way in mysterious locations. The reader does not begin to understand when or where the book is taking place until nearly 4 chapters in, when it becomes clear that the book is happening in the slave-holding South.The novel changes perspective several times, at once being from the perspective of the trees around a plantation but then again taking place from the perspective of a slave. In other spots, the narrative shifts to a third-person perspective. All in all, the changes in voice make it difficult at times to keep track of who is narrating the piece.On the surface, the novel might appear to be a traditional story, but it is truly a fascinating examination of the cruel and terrible system of slavery that held sway over the South prior to and during the Civil War. The book attempts to humanize one particular slaveholder, and succeeds in doing so. The slaveholder is depicted as fickle, at once sympathetic towards his slaves but then cruel and inhumane towards them, demonstrating that he, while a cruel taskmaster, is not completely comfortable with his own behavior.If you are seeking an easy read, keep looking. On the other hand, if you want a powerful, insightful view into the horror of slavery, this book is an excellent choice.",4.0
"Winter Jones is determined to keep her excellent paying job in order to continue sending funds to her sister to support their aunt's medial needs.  However, life has thrown her two major curve balls that could hinder her plan.  Without discussing with her, Winter's roommate has decided to move in with her crazy boyfriend from hell.  And to complicate matters on an even more on a personal level, Winter has been covertly lusting after her wealthy, drop-dead gorgeous boss, the one man she knows she cannot have.For the past year, Eric Jameson has secretly been obsessing over his housekeeper.  With each passing day, his desire for Winter Jones has slowly stewed until the point where Eric is just moments away from breaking his number one rule of never mixing business with pleasure by claiming Winter as his woman.I found Tami Vinson's Winter's Heat to be a pleasant read.  Where Eric is a tough, hard-core very alpha male who demands respect without question; Winter is an innocent, kind-hearted, yet determined heroine who finds the inner strength that she never knew she had when confronted with an unbelievable harmful act.  The couple is a perfect match for each other.  It amazes me how long it took for Eric and Winter to finally submit to their desires for one another; yet, when they finally did, it was no turning back to the way things used to be.  The sexual tension between them is intensely hot and very passionate.  All in all, Winter's Heat is a good read.This book was reviewed by Nikita Steele for Joyfully Reviewed (JR), and was provided by the publisher/author at no cost to JR for the purpose of being reviewed.",4.0
this is one of her best book. i loved the hero and the heroine. they both have issues and they worked on it instead of hurting each other badly. they loved each other and it showed that looks do not matter. this is a good read. both of them were prideful people. the hero did not think the heroine was beautiful. at the end it did not matter. he loved his wife.,5.0
"Two elks is the best on mountain lunch restaurant at Vail. Great timberframe building with 50 foot ceilings and a great atmosphere. The food is fresh and they turn out a lot of it. Lunch runs the gamut from big salads to pasta dishes to a grlll for hamburgers and chicken sandwiches to baked potatos and a Mexican station for burritos.

Its pricey as you should expect but they do offer the $9.95 daily sandwich, fry & drink meal though which helps. Located at the top of the mountain, Two Elks is Vail's nicest on mountain lunch restaurant and sitting outside overlooking the back bowls and Blue Sky Basin on a sunny day is paradise.",3.0

"The cover of this story features a couple of scoops of vanilla, ones that might, if fully unveiled, might features cherries atop those mounds, but frozen delights?  I suspect they'd melt frozen foods.Tessa fantasizes about Shane, whose large orange truck delivers her diet plan, although she was thin enough not to need one.  Perhaps the author should have put him in a yellow Schwann's truck, which comes more frequently, and carries frozen pizza (they make a couple of premium grocery store pizza brands) and ice cream that's as good as Turkey Hill.  On the other hand, my Schwann man was always in a rush, making it difficult to add a 3-pounf box of PDQ shrimp or a 2.5 gallon tin of chocolate almond ice cream.  C'mon, there's more sales commissions in digging more out of the truck than in driving it to the next house, isn't there?Ah,but we're reviewing fiction, not frozen food delivery. The story develops slowly, as much women's porn does, as he lusts for her, and she for him, without anyone willing to make the first move.Once the author stops humming Carly Simon's ""Anticipation"" in her mind, and starts humming Rod ""Stewart's ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"", the story gets a little mechanical, and a little, dare I say it, boring?  A male-oriented author would have been humming Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and moved into ""Bicycle Race""so that the well-thumbed pages would deserve to be well-thumbed.  Of course, a male-oriented author would have been humming ""Fat Bottomed Girls (Make The Rockin' World Go Round)"" when he introduced us to Tessa.  And, I would remind you, Queen got its name for being flaming queens, not for being as stoic royals such as Queen Elizabeth.There's nothing wrong with this story as being women's erotica, except that it doesn't qualify as prurient matter, there being no pruritis induced.  And if you deflate the balloon, there's not much reason to read erotica, is there?The whole thing reminds me of a Craigslist ad that went viral, offering a nearly-full box of 36 Magnum rubbers, that being a size few guys can fill, and the three missing rubbers being a reminder that she can't seem to keep a relationship going, she was offering the rest for free, as long as the recipient was polite in requesting it.  It made me want to call her up, just to talk.Because, you know, although my little brother insists that sex is like business; when it's great, it's great, and when it's bad, it's not bad. Little brother, though has never owned a business.  I have, and let me tell you, when it comes to bad sex, I'd rather share a cup of coffee with a nice lady who is able to carry her half of an engaging conversation. After all, we talk of having sexual relations, and there are no relations without a relationship.  One might as well buy a Resusci-Annie.Maybe, just maybe, some women will really enjoy this book, but I would rather enjoy a cup of Chock-Full-O-Nuts coffee, black, while listening to Maria Bartiromo conduct an interview on CNBC.Masturbation, as Robert Heinlein pointed out inTime Enough for Love, is cheap, clean, convenient, and free of any possibility of wrongdoing -- and you don't have to go home in the cold.

"I was gifted this book from the Author for an honest review.I gave this book 5 stars.This is book one in the Breathe Series . . . The series should be read as a series and not as a stand alone.Rachel Brookes is a phenomenal writer, she had me captivated from the very beginning with this book . . .This is Savannah and Tate's book.Savannah has been through too much in her young life she lost both of her parents and then she lost her boyfriend to a suicide, that she and everyone else from her old town blame her for. She is use to using guys to get what she wants. A break. She sleeps with them and then slinks off and leaves them after one night. She has rules and she never breaks them. That is until she moves to the states and gets a new job, new friends, and meets Tate. Then all her rules are all shot to hell.She meets Tate in the elevator (Lift) going up to her apartment, and after all is said and done she finds out that he is the twin to her friend that she has never met until she comes to the states. This makes for an awkward beginning. :)Tate is a playboy and sleeps with anything, if it walks and talks and is a woman he will sleep with it. He has his own set of problems but when Savannah comes into his life, his life is never going to be the same. They turn each others worlds upside down. With all that is going to go against them can they handle it and keep a relationship? Can they both put away their whorish ways and have a relationship? And when the past comes back to haunt them how are they going to handle it.I loved this book, it kept me interested and turning the pages. I wanted to read faster so I could find out what was going to happen but wanted to slow down so I could savor the book. Yeah that is the kind of book it is. Tate is a heart throb, gorgeous, damaged man. He is beautiful and is so worth the time to get to know and be with. Savannah is not that bad of a catch either, once you get her walls down and she learns to trust you she is loyal and amazing. And although she has been hurt so much in her life I do believe that Tate can heal those wounds for her enough to be able to live her life without feeling guilt.As her daddy said she needs to Just Breathe and let fate take her where she needs to be. Thank you for this amazing story .. I cannot wait to read book 2",5.0

"Steve Berry has written a great stand alone story for his hero Cotton Malone. Using a somewhat alternate timeline to invent the British Royal family, Berry delivers a novella of political intrigue and murder. Cotton Malone is secretly recruited by the Queen of England to uncover a plot she fears is in motion to upset the line of succession to the established monarchy.I typically enjoy Steve Berry's fast paced action thrillers; however I wasn't fond of this one. It might have just been me, I may have missed it, but I don't know why he called this novella ""The Tudor Plot"", since there was much more about the Arthurian legend. I felt as if there were really two different ideas mushed into this one ebook, and I couldn't truly find the connection between them. As such, I felt slightly disconnected from the characters and their personal struggles and wishes.Because this novella is totally stand-alone, the reader doesn't need any of Cotton Malone's history to try this adventure out. Likewise, since it is totally stand-alone, the reader does not need to read this story to keep up with Steve Berry's Cotton Malone series.http://storeyonastory.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/the-tudor-plot-by-steve-berry/",2.0

"The author is meant to be from Wellington but got facts wrong - the beach house is at least an hour away, passports do not take forever to turn up (10 days max) and a couple of other minor things. Why is the main character working? That is never clear. The only reason these people appear to be interested in each other is because they fooled around when they were kids which borders on abuse. There is a &#34;mystery&#34; about who the guy really is tied in with the girls grandparents but she never stops to think that they might be related (spoiler: they aren't).

Fortunately, Rhythm & Blues can be read as a standalone & my enjoyment of this book did not suffer at all from not having read the first installment yet. I absolutely adored this book. This book was filled with wit & humor; Molly Harper is an absolute genius with dialogue. The plot was very original & interesting, the characters were likable, and the romance had well balanced amounts of sexual tension, sweetness & steam (I was totally swooning over the country-boy/mayor hero).

Tarquin has no qualms about bedding any conquests, male or female, it's all just sex to him.Sometimes they share a woman, although that isn't really Marc's preference, but he does it as a way to get closer to Tarquin. One night they woman they've chosen is not one of the regular courtesans at the brothel, masked and hooded, they suspect she's a married woman.She is indeed married, to a powerful sorcerer and when he catches Marc and Tarquin with her, he turns them both to stone statues and after centuries they end up in Las Vegas as a statue in one of the hotels, probably Ceasar's Palace :)They return to their human form for a day on the anniversary of the curse and they've spent the intervening years researching the curse and how to lift it as well as amassing quite a bit of money over time.Review copy from NetgalleyThey can still talk to each other through their minds while statues, but they can't move and Marc still hasn't got the courage to admit his love for Tarquin, afraid of losing the only friend he has.It's quite a short story that fits a lot in and is easily read in one sitting. We get both points of view, which was good, but at times I felt like shaking them. Neither wanted to take the first step to progress from friendship to something more. They both evolved over the years they were trapped and probably learned a lot more about each other as they could only communicate with each other while in statue form. They took their time to figure out they really did want each other!The love scenes between them are hot and sensual and contrasted well with the scenes in the brothel, where they were just there for sex. It's a sweet story overall, not too much angst, but enough to keep you wondering whether they will ever get the curse lifted and get their happily ever after. I would have liked a bit more of the setting to have been Ancient Rome, but that's probably just the history fan in me coming out.",4.0

"This was an enjoyable read. Sometimes life&#8217;s greatest gifts come from the unexpected.Erin thought she had everything she needed. Her life was wonderful . Then life threw her a curveball. Her best friend Noelle won&#8217;t let her just wallow in her pain and sadness. She decided to take matters into her own hands and get Erin out of the house and back on the horse. One night changes Erin&#8217;s life forever. It is unexpected but just because she didn&#8217;t plan it doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t meant to be.  I love that Noelle is there for Erin no matter what and is an amazing support system for her.Walker was a super sweet, super sexy guy. I love that he never gave up or backed down from what he wanted&#8230;Erin. He didn&#8217;t care that the way they met was unconventional or that meeting changed everything for his life. He wasn&#8217;t scared to tell everyone exactly how he felt about Erin or what he intentions were. I loved the whole green game. (I don&#8217;t want to give it away but you&#8217;ll understand what that means once you read the book).This was a sweet book about life&#8217;s unexpected gifts and how they can sometimes be the best things to happen to a person.",4.0

This location has some higher end items that you won't find in the Antioch or 100 Oaks locations, but it doesn't seem the have great deals as the Brentwood one.

"That bitter sweet day has come it seems.
The former head chef of ZAIKIA, that Willy Wonk of Vindaloo, Mohammed Butt, no longer holds his former standing of proprietor and chief creator of all things indo-pak worth tasting in north east Philly.
The time had come to the torch pass and for the his student to surpass the master.

A former sous Chef has taken the rains and a new proprietor has crawled out of the wood works, yet what's most surprising is that there little to no decrease in the quality of the food! In fact, the naan was staggeringly good on my last order. The interior of the restaurant has been given a fresh coat of paint and a few aesthetic adjustments made, it now resembling a eat-in establishment rather than just take-out place with a few tables.

What is even better to see is that the former chef and proprietor retains a relationship with the new, respectfully. I witnessed this during Ramadan when old guard and new were working together to keep up on likely their busiest day of the year.

I would also like to add that the new proprietors English is likely better then my own. So worry not about any language barrier and should you be clueless regarding the cuisine, I am sure she can assist.",5.0
"Yelpers, I'm telling you that you've got to check out this bar, for a couple of reasons. One, it's new and kind of hidden, so you'll be totally in-the-know about a pub that many people haven't heard of yet. Two, because it's so new and little-known, it's not super busy (yet). Three, it's great!

The first thing I really like in here is the decor. It's got a cool, very modern red vibe. It's got that welcoming kind of ""anyone welcome"" vibe and that kind of feel that it could host anything from a UFC night to a small jazz performance.

I haven't tried any food, but the drinks are cold and the staff are friendly!",4.0

"First let me wipe the tears away. The sadness and pain that Sawyer feels in the prologue is palpable. The fear breaks my heart.The journey that Sawyer embarks on to find out about her family and about love is good--like Jack Kerouac good. When she opens up her heart and mind to the love that is all around her, her strength and sense of self grows. Which is saying a lot considering how amazing Sawyer is in Him and Her. She tells it like it is all the while keeping a distance from any commitments.Then there is Jared. Jared gets Sawyer completely-heart and soul. Carey has given him a wonderful voice. I love the 1/2 chapters, I love knowing Jared's mind. How much he misses her, how well he knows her and loves her..how he will be happy being Uncle Jared if that is what she wants! When Luke and Jared are at the studio-how Jared goes there to check in cause he knows that will make Sawyer happy. (Maybe I love Sawyer too much?? naaaaaaah!)Beautiful when Marie tells Sawyer-- &#34;you love him. The rest is thinking too much.&#34;The letters Carmen gives her. When she calls Sarah I started crying again-&#34;she cries for me&#34; and Sawyer allowing herself to believe she is loved...And when she tells Jared she loves him-that scene is crystal clear to me in my head.Especially love how Jared is still his own person even while he gives his heart to Sawyer, and would never ask her to change-just to trust him and let him in.Love the ease and passion between Sawyer and Jared. They fit. Even after knowing each other so long they are still learning about each other. Their transition from friends to lovers- while rocky in the beginning- grew with ease.I loved this book, it blended the right amount of romance, grief, hope, friendship and hot as hell love.

"Andrea Randall and Charles Sheehan-Miles, Nocturne (Andrea Randall and Charles Sheehan-Miles, 2013)full disclosure: this book was provided to me free of charge by one of its authors for review purposes.I've been reading Charles Sheehan-Miles' books for twelve years now; I got a copy of Prayer at Rumayla back in 2001. After reading and reviewing it, I was on a roadtrip from Cleveland to Providence, RI (twelve and a half hours each way if you get stuck in rush hour traffic in New York City, unfortunately) with a friend of mine, a veteran of Gulf War I, in March of 2002. I gave him my copy, and he spent most of the trip immersed in it. Instead of giving it back to me, he passed it on to a person he'd served with. I like to think that all these years later, it's still making the rounds among Iraq veterans. I've been reading Sheehan-Miles' stuff ever since. Andrea Randall, on the other hand, is new to me. It's a mark in Nocturne's favor that I couldn't tell where one writer left off and the other began. (I'm assuming it's facile--and spurious--to simply assign Gregory's bits to Sheehan-Miles and Savannah's to Randall.) On the other hand, it makes me want to pigeonhole all the book's shortcomings to Randall, which probably isn't fair. I'll try to avoid doing so, and I apologize in advance if I fail.It has seemed to me for the past decade and change that, speaking very broadly, there are two kinds of romance novels these days: there's the classical romance novel, where the main characters don't end up together until the very last page, and then there's the ""new"" romance novel, where the characters actually end up together about halfway through the book and must face a united front against external pressures attempting to tear them apart. Telling you which of these types Nocturne is would be a major spoiler, obviously, but here's another mark in the book's favor: by a few pages into this book, you will think you know which of them it is. You are incorrect. Given the inherent limitations of genre romance, with predictability being at the top of that list, any chance an author has to throw a few curve balls into the mix is a good thing.Plot: The authors waste no time in kicking boundaries; when we first meet Savannah Marshall, Nocturne's heroine, she's seventeen years old, auditioning for a spot at the New England Conservatory. We meet her form the perspective of Gregory Fitzgerald, an instructor at the school and the youngest principal cellist in the history of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, twenty-seven at the time. We dodge the possible ephebophilia with Part One of the book taking place three years later, when Savannah is in her junior year and in a music theory class that Gregory is tabbed to teach at the last minute. Sparks fly from the get-go as Gregory's traditional ideas towards music collide with Savannah's progressiveness. Doesn't help that each thinks the other is exceptionally easy on the eyes. From there, well--must I tell you? It's a romance novel.There's some great setup here, and Gregory and Savannah are well-drawn characters who--mostly, at least--react in believable ways to the situations they find themselves in. Though that does lead to the book's first drawback, as one of the ways in which our authors get things to happen on the book's schedule is the deus ex machina of ""and then three years passed"", which I mentioned above. (It is invoked more than once in this book.) That kind of undercuts the believability, especially that first time; this is not a big, anonymous school, or at least that's the impression I get; is it reasonable to assume that our main characters would be able to completely avoid one another for three years?The book's other shortcomings are, in the main, either more nebulous or more minor. There are a few places the language slips up. (""...her breasts were swollen against his chest...""? That's not sex, that's an infectious disease.) Some of the minor characters are not nearly as well-drawn as the principals, which combines with another problem, that some of the subplot ideas were dangled in front of us and then just kind of disappeared. During the final third of the book there's a character who seems to have been introduced for the sole purpose of creating a sort of love-triangle tension, but then after the first chapter or so where we meet said character, whose sex I am trying not to reveal in order to avoid spoilers (which is making this very difficult to write, I must say), s/he only appears every once in a while, delivers a cutting remark, and then vanishes back into the woodwork. Eh?I also mentioned up top that for the most part, our main characters approach the situations they find themselves in/make for themselves in a logical, believable way. There is one huge exception to this. Going into it would constitute a major spoiler. But you'll know it when you see it.None of these shortcomings is enough to say ""you shouldn't read this book."" (And neither is the cover. Graphic is fine. Text chosen...not so much. But you already noticed that when you saw the cover graphic above, didn't you?) With the obvious caveat of ""if romance novels are your bag""--in other words, if the unspoken baggage that comes along with genre romance is okay with you (the general predictability, the sometimes-stretched bits where characters walk into conversations a little too late and thus misinterpret everything--though I will rush to add that in this particular novel, that sort of nonsense is kept to a minimum, and the one pivotal point where it happens here is very well-thought-out)--then yes, absolutely, you want to pick up a copy of this. Let me put it this way: when I signed up for the blog tour, I (arbitrarily, if you must know) decided I'd post on August 31st. The book popped up in my email box a week before that. What? You want me to read and review a book in a single week? For the love of... (my current record for time lapse between view and review is eighteen months, which is why I never do deadlines). In any case, I fired it up on the Kindle for PC and saw that Nocturne has, roughly, seven thousand ""locations"". (Hey Amazon, can't you just use page numbers like everyone else in the world since, oh, Gutenberg?) Okay, I thought to myself, that's a thousand locations a day and still time to dash off a review. By the end of the first day I'd made it to the magic number of 2112, and the second day, I finished it. Both of these authors know how to keep the (virtual) pages turning, and turning quickly. I think it probably could have used one more round of sand, coat, and polish before being completely ready for prime time to smooth out a few of the lumps mentioned above, but if you're looking for a good, solid read, Nocturne will fill the bill. ***",3.0
"In a small town where the gossip hub is the local beauty shop, and it's impossible to hide a secret, The Future Widow's Club meets under the guise of being a Bingo club.

It goes almost like an AA meeting&#8230; introduce yourself, state your status (widow or &#34;future&#34;), and detail for the group what steps you have taken since the last meeting to prepare for widowhood.  Appropriate steps include upping the life insurance policy, making advanced funeral arrangements, and of utmost importance is purchasing &#34;THE Outfit&#34;.  The dress and all appropriate accessories to be worn to the funeral&#8230; a hat with a veil is a must, so as to hide one's smirks and smiles throughout the service.  At the end of the meeting, all members meet and greet the new ladies, stating their name, status, and an appropriate sentiment, ex) May he never rest in peace, congratulations on your un-dearly departed, etc.The main character becomes the suspect of a murder investigation when her jerk husband turns up dead just after she begins enthusiastically participating with all recommended steps toward widowhood&#8230; It doesn't help that the lead investigator is her former (and first) love.

"Where to start, I liked the blurb for this book but in reality it never lived up to expectations. The beginning was very slow and took along while to get going, the idea was good and some of the characters were interesting but the first half could in all honesty have been half the length I found myself skimming just to get through it. The main problem was Skye at one point she's described as &#34; weak and stupid and gullible&#34; I couldn't agree more she was weak, annoying, irritating and living in denial more than any character I've ever read. I've said the idea was good and it was or it could have been, but it was so implausible at times, I know it's a werewolf romance but regardless of the subject matter I personally need to like and relate to the character I'm reading about and that just didn't work in this case. Even when being told directly by someone she trusts Skye still refuses to believe what's going on around her and sticks her head in the sand, she's all about saving and loving River but then ignores everything that comes out of his mouth refusing to see what's right in front of her eyes and don't get me started on her grandmother....So in summary I liked the sound of this book but it just didn't work for me it's seriously needs condensing and Skye needs well how much time have we got...I received ARC copy of this book from NetGalley.",2.0
"I received a copy of This Tangled Thing Called Love in exchange for an honest review. Claire Chatfield has the best life. She is successful, has great girlfriends, and has just received a massive rock from her now fianc&eacute;, David Lawson. David is one of the most sought-after bachelors in New York City thanks to his elite status and sizeable bank account. But Claire's world is rocked when photos appear in a tabloid magazine of David locking lips with an aging Hollywood actress. Claire calls off the engagement, and is forced to face her true feelings - she didn't have the overwhelming in love feeling with David. He was reliable, solid, and safe....but Claire knows she wants more. When she starts spending more time with her sex on a stick neighbor, Alec, Claire thinks she has the found the man she could spend forever with. A tango dance instructor, Alec sweeps Claire off her feet and also makes a startling connection with her career. Will Claire finally have the courage to go after what she really wants in life?I thought This Tangled Thing Called Love was a cute and sweet romance novel. Claire is a great heroine, someone who was duped by the one she loved, but it turned out to be for the best. Claire had been ignoring her feelings about her relationship with David for too long. The POV gives readers insight on a slew of characters - Claire being the lead, but also Alec, David and even David's fling - Claudia. I liked that we got just enough of glimpse into their thoughts - nothing too overwhelming where it was confusing. One flaw I thought was that I didn't think there was enough on Claire and Alec's relationship. It really didn't come into play until the second half of the book, and I thought that was too long. The majority of the book focused on Claire and David's relationship, but I would have liked to see more Alec in there. There were some enjoyable subplots as well, including Claire's work and friendships, and overall I thought this was a very quick and pleasant read that I would recommend.",4.0
"The Markhat novels are invariably a delight, and this newest novel is no exception.I think what I love most about these stories may well be the colorful, quirky, fabulously interesting supporting cast.  Each of Markhat's friends is well-drawn and memorable, and each has a well-defined voice.  They're vibrant, funny, and distinct.The plot is lively and gripping, with plenty of action and suprising twists.  The world building, while not extensive, is consistent and clear.

"For a while I was uncertain whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars. I wish Amazon had the option of giving half stars! Eventually I settled on 4 stars because I think the author has fully captured the raw emotion that goes hand in hand with the subject matter.I bought this book back in November and read it within a month of purchasing it. If I  were to review it back then, I would have given it 3 stars because I was under the impression from the book blurb that this was a truly paranormal novel. However, I am glad I have not reviewed it until now, since the book description has been tidied up, and the subject matter is now clear.Depression is such a horrible illness to have to suffer through and the author has captured this so cleverly. I was in pain along with her as I devoured the words. At times it is hard to read, both for the content matter and for the fact that the wording is scrambled. But I would never want the author to change it since she has done that hard task of capturing the moment so completely.Great work Vicky!",4.0

"Dealing with the paranormal can make anyone crazy!Right from the start we are thrown into this crazy reality where humans aren't as safe as they believe they are. Wraiths, creatures that come from an alternate dimension have been breaking into our world and attempting to overtake us for centuries and the only ones who can stop it are diminishing in numbers. The paranormal aspects were very well done and had me hooked. I couldn't put the book down and was thoroughly engrossed in this world. The author did a great job of giving us bits of information at decent intervals throughout the book. It was so much fun to discover the mysteries of this world right along with Addison.Addison was a fun, sometimes sarcastic, and a very relateable character. Shes been dealing with this paranormal stuff from a very young age, but that doesn't make it any less freaky. You would think she would be relieved when she finds out the truth about what shes been seeing, but instead it opens up a whole new can of worms. I really admired her strength and tenacity throughout this book. She had so much dumped on her, but she could roll with the punches and always kept a cool head. Well except where Asher was concerned. She really grew a lot throughout the book and I grew to love her and can't wait to see where she goes next.Asher could really get on your nerves. He was irritating,arrogant, and just plain grouchy. However as the story progressed we did get to see a bit of his background and kind of understand where he was coming from. He was still arrogant, but it takes time to teach an old dog new tricks. By far he was definitely one of the most interesting characters and I can't wait to see where the story takes him next.For an exciting new tale in the new adult industry check out Darkness Rising!",4.0

"I strongly urge you to go grab a copy to find out what the fuss is all about. I'm not one for giving away details of the story but as always, I will do my best to convince you that you NEED to read this book.In this new series by Lorraine Nelson, which has beautiful cover-art, she introduces us to the Hudsons. If you are familiar with Lorraine's Thunder Creek Ranch Series and the Manning family, then you already know how incredibly amazing her families are. Each features strong female leads, HOT ranchers and families that we all wish we knew personally. The Inheritance and the Hudsons are no different.The Inheritance brings us Zackary Hudson, a man who's ""clock is ticking"", Bianca and Jeremiah, Zack's new wife and young toddler, and the search for Zack's three oldest children...triplets...and from the sounds of it, just as sexy as their father.We find ourselves involved in the hunt to reunite a father kept away from his sons by an angry, vindictive ex-wife and though we are given thoughts and feelings of each of the main characters (even an insight into Zack's lawyer/friend, Bart)...it deepens the story and creates a ""hit-home"" scenario on an incredibly personal subject.I believe many readers, women and men alike will love this family. Their struggles, hopes and dreams are so believable, palpable that I became hooked from the get-go. The urgency is evident from the first page and the ending of this short story/introduction to The Hudson Ranch Series will...leave...you...breathless and dying to get your hands on the next book!

"To be honest, I don't know what people who have posted here were expecting from Ruth Chris's.  (""You can't please everyone?"")

My first visit to Ruth's a few days ago was my first and it certainly was not my last.  I already anticipate my next visit - which I hope is soon enough.

I was impressed with the timeliness of service and the arrival of each course to my table.  From the barbequed shrimp to the salad (which was a basic salad, but was one of the best salads I've ever had while eating out), to the stuffed chicken breast, to my sides of asparagus with Hollandaise sauce and mashed potatoes - the food was plated beautifully (we were even warned by our server of how hot the dishes would be when they came out and to be careful not to touch them.  He was right and then some!)

I chose an Italian red to go with the main course and while I should have gotten tipsy by the amount of wine I was served, I didn't so much as feel flushed.  The wine was beyond delicious and complemented my meal beautifully.

And the dessert topped off what was an out of this world meal.  Their crème brulee is the best I've ever had - hands down - and their coffee was so good it failed to make me jittery.  It was the perfect topper.  I was sorry to have that come to an end.

The hostess and wait staff were courteous, friendly, and, above all, professional.  My server, Duran, was an absolute sweetheart.  He and his helpers kept coming to my table, to make sure we liked our meal.  I also saw him do this with his other tables.

I saw how professional and courteous the staff here was upon entering when we were seated sans reservations.  Granted, we arrived shortly after opening for dinner, but other places of this caliber would turn you away or make you wait to be seated.

After my visit, I floated home and went to bed quite satisfied.  I woke up the next morning barely hungry.  That one meal satisfied me for nearly 2 days!

I was treated beautifully by the staff here and I have no reservations about making a return trip here.  I'm sorry to see others may have had a below par experience, but there are some reviews I just can't take seriously (you just don't like the name of the place, yet you keep coming here ... and in different cities?  Really?).

Bottom line: I can't rave enough about this place.  (Outback who?)",5.0
"Overall, I really enjoyed this book! I have been reading a lot of books lately because of my power outage and this was a really great one!!I really liked how this story was really orginal and very different then other mermaid stories that I have read. The only complaint that I have with this book is that it felt really rushed and I wish the story was dragged out a little bit more.Otherwise, I really enjoyed this book and I hope you all will too :)",4.0

"The biggest flaw is that Foster's advice is vague to the point of uselessness.If you've ever subscribed (or regularly read) any women's magazine, there's absolutely nothing new for you. Invest in basics, save on trends. Purge what you don't wear. Buy things that fit well. Really, that's about it.If you are completely clueless on style or fashion, this book is still not much help because it doesn't offer any guide. For example, it advises you to invest in a well fitting pair of jeans because it's a priceless staple in any women's wardrobe. I agree. However, what constitutes a good, flattering fit? If you know, you don't need this book. If you don't, this book won't tell you. There are no pictures, no charts, no description, nothing really.In Foster's defense, I'm sure she's a very fashionable person; she genuinely sounds like she knows what she's talking about. However, in her attempts to break fashion down to the basics (in order to appeal to the biggest audience) she comes across far too broad. Clear out what you don't wear so that they don't clutter up your closet and muddle up your style. Wear well fitting basics and add a fashionable accent piece. Splurge on the pieces you will wear most often; skimp on the ones you won't. That's her book summed up.",2.0
"Besides the fact that this book is very well written, there are two things I loved about it.  First, the characters are nice people.  Both of them seemed normal and likeable.  Their romance progressed in a natural fashion.  They took time to get to know each other before making a commitment of any sort.  They both were willing to put someone else's needs before their own, and to me that's what love is all about.Second, I liked the book because of the compassion the author showed toward animals.  I don't understand cruelty to animals, and I hope I never do.  How anyone could gain any sort of satisfaction from hurting an animal is beyond my comprehension.  I appreciate a author of this caliber who speaks up for those who have no voice.What's my rating?  Five stars, and I hope you pick up a copy.",5.0

"A Wife By Christmas is truly a wonderful read...and don't let the title fool you...this is way more than a Christmas story...this is a fun LOVE STORY complete with humor and tight family bonds!I enjoyed touching base again with many favorite characters from A Run For Love...like Tori & Jesse and Michael and many more.Max Colbert starts off as a stodgy, disciplined man who doesn't want any type of upheavel in his life.  Ellie Henderson is upheavel times ten!  Her spirited determination and well meaning ways are just what Max needs to loosen up.When he comes up with a plan to marry Ellie off to anyone he can think of...all in an effort to get her out of his mind and life...it totally backfires.  He realizes his own feelings for her in the process and in between many fun and funny scenes.You just can't help but fall in love with both Max and Ellie and root for them on their journey.I will definitely be looking for more books written by Ms. Hutton :)",5.0

"My Review:I love the setting for this book. Willa is the medical responder for several small Alaska towns. She gets to them through daily flights and Liam is her new pilot. Just the whole aspect of the medical response needed in the Alaskan wilderness was completely fascinating and I loved this insight into it through Willa and Liam's story.I also really enjoyed their story. They've both been incredibly hurt by other relationships and neither one is willing to open themselves up to that again. What they are willing to do, is have a little fun together because their chemistry is good....really good.I liked how these two related to each other and after a fairly rocky start begin to truly work as a team on medical missions and emergencies. Their friendship and partnership is real and for me, that's a great basis for a romantic story line.I liked the addition of Liam's uncle Jason. He added a great dimension to the story line, especially since he's one of Willa's trusted friends. On the other hand, I wish Edward, Liam's dad, had been left out. I felt like his part just added confusion.There was a plot twist at the end of the book which I wish had been done differently. It made the book just a little too cliche. Call me a romantic, but I like my Hero and Heroine to realize their love is real without story line twists like this. But despite that, I felt like this was a good book. I really enjoyed it and definitely became immersed in the story. I am quickly becoming a fan of Julie Rowe's writing!",4.0
"The signs of abuse, no matter what form, can speak so softly, be  hidden so well, dress sooo beautifully, no one would know what was beneath the surface.In Landon's story,RH Ramsey pulls us in by showing us how abuse can be hidden behind perfection,  wrapped in a velvet glove, tied with friendship, packaged in the familiar faces of loved ones, and is almost totally buried.I am not one for remembering names, but I remember emotions. Beneath the Surface is embroiled with scenes of tenderness,  denial, shock, love, betrayal, amazement and you live each and everyone of them. . I was entranced with this story.I was totally surprised at where the story went and how deep money could bury truth.This is not a feel good story. It is an awakening.

"This short story's plot line is similar to many others:  girl has lifelong crush on best friend's older brother and he finally notices her when she's all grown up (see The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheevers).  Unfortunately, the story is too short for any character development and it's unconvincing.  Both characters are two dimensional.  This story is an okay escape for a couple of hours - less time if you find yourself skipping pages like I did.",2.0
"I have been a huge fan of this series from day 1.  I thought the volumes were well written, character development were great and story line kept you hooked the entire time.  I have been patiently waiting for this last volume and see what would happen to Paul and Emily.  I have to say that the ending was good, but I will have to agree with other reviewers here.  The last volume could have been expanded on.  It seemed like while the other volumes had a lot of development, sequence of events, this last volume simply flew by and left me with a few unaswered questions and wanting to see more from this couple.Overall, this story was amazing.  I was completely emotionally invested in this couple.  I was happy for them, I felt their pain and their anguish.  It was a very emotional and romantic series.  I will definitely read it over and over.  It is a bittersweet moment for me, I loved that everything worked out in the end, but I am sad to see this series end.  I also wish this last volume would have been a bit longer and just as detailed as the previous volumes.  But it was definitely worth reading!  I can't wait to see what is next in store from Ms. Adams.",5.0
"Team Javier? Team Camden? Neither. I am Team Ellie all the way.Action, terror, threats, survival and a path to self discovery is what Bold Tricks was for me. Gone were all innocents from before leaving nothing but a rude awakening. Picking up right where we left off in Book two Ellie sits between the two men that she has loved. Or loves? A crossroads the likes of which she has never crossed.The lives of her family members hang in the balance. Can she survive it? Hell YES! Today October 15, 2013 is release day and you will get no spoilers from me. I will tell you that Bold Tricks had my heart in my throat, tears in my eyes, heart bursting with joy and then ripped me apart multiple times. It is what Karina Halle does best as a writer. She takes us on a ride and then makes us want to get on again even though we know it might make us sick. We just can't stop.Roof top chases, high speed getaways and shootouts follow a path of blood, lies and betrayal. Who's team will win and whose team do you belong .Ultimately there is only one team that matters, Ellie. She has to learn to trust her own instincts. Find her own truth and realize her decisions have impacts she never thought possible. I highlighted so many quotes in Bold Tricks and after re-reading there is just no way I can give them to you. The reader needs to go in spoiler free. You must to get the full effect of the ride.Put simply if you are a fan of The Artist Trilogy books you will get all your questions answered. You will be satisfied and sated in ways not expected. I know I was.Strap yourselves in guys it's gonna be a crazy ride!5 STARST~",5.0
"Nicholas and Pearl were great characters!  Even though the story was short, I felt I learned the personalities of them both.  While the role of the ex-husband was explored I felt there was more to that story that could have been developed.  I won't give any spoilers, but I did figure out the culprit when he was first mentioned.  I'm not sure what gave him away, but I spent the remainder of the book anticipating how he would be revealed.  I can't wait for the next installment in the series.",4.0
"*Slight Spoilers*The main character has certainly met his. This story begins with a whole lot of violence and the sense that it&#8217;s for good reason. We never learn the doctor&#8217;s name&#8212;but somehow even that works in the way the story is old. The doctor is meticulous in targeting, acquiring and dispensing of his victims. It first comes across as brutal because it is. It&#8217;s raw throughout, every emotion and detail moves the reader along the doctor&#8217;s journey.The best part is when the book begins to get into the &#8216;why?&#8217; of things. I won&#8217;t wreck it. I will say that this plot was fabulous and very well thought out. It left me wanting to know more every time I put it down. Anyone looking for a thriller will enjoy this book immensely.I&#8217;m uncertain if this was a beta-type copy or the final product, but there were a noticeable number of editing misses scattered throughout. I felt that this was a shame because the story is SO good. However the misses did take away from it enough for me to begin to lose focus on the story.Overall, I&#8217;d do it again. I feel that the story overcame the flaws (and I&#8217;d like to point out how perfect it would be without them.) It was a great psychological ride from beginning to end.",3.0

The problem is that, if you are a good woman, an intelligent woman, a sexy woman, and a good person you don't want or need to be alpha.

"Lyra Bryan must step out of her strawberry perfume life and save her colony and a hot alien at all costs in Aubrie Dionne's Alliance. The third book in the Paradise Reclaimed series, this novel picks up where Reconnaissance left off, but with Lyra telling the story. Lyra is a sweet girl, although she seems a little bit of a space head at the start. I love how she grows as a character. Asteran, the handsome alien from Priavenus, has such a sad story, and his plight tugged on my heartstrings. This fast-paced read sent me to the planet Paradise 21 and across the universe with Dionne's lyrical prose. And the alien arachnids still give me nightmares. Although I would've liked to know more of what happened to the characters at the end, Alliance by Aubrie Dionne is a wonderful addition to the Paradise Reclaimed series, and I recommend it to anyone who loves sweet sci-fi romance.",5.0

"Roped In by Sindra van YsselBook 1 of the Bondage Ranch series started off strong for me however 10 chapters made the ending to quick.  I think it would have been a very good book and a more satisfying story if it was a full length novel versus just a good short story.  I will be looking into more of this series.Basically the majority of the story was about the weekend Laera and Bruce meet. I enjoyed the `Master Zen' Bruce relationship with Laera and the patience he had introducing her to the BDSM life style.  The scenes they shared were very hot and I enjoyed the humor that was interspersed through out the story.My favorites...""You smell wonderful,"" he told her. ""So aroused.""  ""That's the bug spray,"" she said.""Mae West had it right--try anything once, do it again if you like it.""""Stay away from Mistress Laera,"" said Frank, ""or I'll find grounds to sue your ass off.

"Milo James Fowler is one of my favorite short story writers, I know him online and we share a background in education and spec fiction writing. So that's the disclaimer - I'm inclined to be biased. However, I read this post-apocalyptic, dystopic tale with some skepticism since I've also written a short saga in this ""after the bomb"" vein. But I was pleasantly surprised. First, this story goes a different direction than what I was expecting. And second, it leaves a lot for the imagination - and is ripe for a sequel. If you're familiar with Hugh Howey'sWool - Part One, then this might be described as a possible future tale in that kind of world, a ""post-silo"" SF/horror, if you will.

"I was pulled into the story right from the start with a good mix of action and story line.  The twist (the MRI) begins a new story with some of the same characters and it starts out ok as well.  The middle of the story gets bogged down in an uninspired attempt to get to the end of the story which was interesting though brief. Because this short story is clearly the beginning of a longer one, I think the author should have tried to keep the intensity consistent throughout.  That it was short and easy to read made it worth the time but I'm not waiting on the sequel.  The interesting ""use"" of the MRI (though stretching the science a bit) has opened a door that could lead to some good stories but they deserve better development.",3.0

"3.5 Stars in my Sky!Amanda Turner and Tate Ryan are TV news presenters who most definitely don't get on - or rather Amanda doesn't like Tate because of some pretty speedy assumptions. When Amanda's ex gets engaged just before she heads home for Christmas she somehow finds herself returning home with Tate in tow as her pretend boyfriend.The book is told in dual POV which is great because we get to see inside Tate's head and see how he's actually in love with Amanda and decides to use the situation to his advantage; his one goal is to change her mind about him and win her heart.On the outside Tate is carefree and easy going, but he's faced a lot of tragedy in his life and didn't really open up to anybody other than a certain female presenter. Amanda likes control and organisation, everything needs to be as planned. She's still plagued by her past and the current situation with her ex Brad.At the start of the book Amanda is pretty self involved, albeit by accident, she's so focused on wallowing in her own misery she hasn't noticed how sweet and kind Tate really is. I honestly have no idea how Amanda couldn't see how Tate felt about her and I couldn't decide whether I found this funny or really frustrating.Short, sweet and funny Christmas Dinner is great for getting you in the holiday spirit or if you just fancy escaping the cold for a while.I received a copy in exchange for an honest review!",3.0

"The attractive thing about James Kipling's mystery books is their underlying message.  Undercover: The Secret of Luck is no different. This crime fiction highlights one man's quest towards self-actualization despite discouragements and against all odds, until...Luck walks through his office door and his life is never the same again.John Russo felt from a very early age, the private detective blood running through his veins and knew instinctively, the type of detective he wanted to be and would not settle for anything less...even at the risk of losing his ever-growing clientele. It wasn't just about the money (and he had quite a bit of that from his booming business), it was about fulfilling a dream. This is the depth of Russo's character.The other characters are also well developed and together, with Russo, bring out other running themes in this mafia mystery - parenting and the value of parental support; teamwork; long term friendship through thick and thin; and care and respect in relationships. ""He loved his dad. He wanted to get up and hug his father... (he) thanked God for giving him such a good friend.""Russo's detective work has an espionage, suspense quality about it that reminds the reader of top movie scenes and characters such as James Bond, Remington Steele and Sherlock Holmes.  The story has constant references to movies. In fact, John loves to watch movies which quite likely are what lit the detective fire in his blood; and his dates are usually dinner and a movie. It was even a torture scene from a movie that Russo used to get information out of a villain. Russo even asked rhetorically while in the middle of his detective work ""Is this some kind of a move?""Kipling's ingenious play on words, and in particular, the names of some of the characters, further deepens the mystery and suspense of the story. You never know who is `undercover', and as far John is concerned, ""even the nicest looking folks could have a dark side to them""; or the deep significance of Rita and Todd Luck in his life; not to mention the likes of Jory Hunger and Dragon who are both true in name and nature.The cover design creatively sums up the book by illustrating the essence of the story - there is always light at the end of a long walk through the forest.",5.0

"After seeing the reviews for this story, most of which were quite favorable, I was looking forward to spending a pleasant half-hour or so reading it.Initially, I found the plot interesting, but I expected the character to grow, to mature over the story. That didn't happen and eventually I came to despise the character.What had started out as a believable modern day tale soon became hard to swallow. The character's actions and self-reflections didn't ring true. That's not to say they don't happen these days, but I just couldn't buy them.Before long I found myself not carrying what happened, halfway wishing the character would commit suicide to end his pathetic life.If the character had had a sympathetic side or had shown any true growth, I would have rated the story higher than 1.5 stars.",1.0

Wow, first of all, it was so taboo, so wrong, but felt amazingly good to read. I love that the story was told from Dorian's p.o.v. The title, Destructively Alluring was so fitting, because Dorian was so intense. His thoughts of Demitra felt and seem like they were driving him crazy and he's going to self destruct and your counting down the minutes he will explode. I felt like I was reading the diary of a crazed man with a need only Demitra can fill. The intensity oozing from Dorian was unlike any I have read. That, and his physical attraction to her was unbelievable. Demitra held her own, although she was so young. I think being around Dorian brought out her confidence from the shy girl you read about in the first chapter. After a while I forgot how young Demitra was, as she seems mature in certain scenes. However, Dorian seem like he was going through puberty and has discovered girls for the first time. That was cute, funny, intense and sexy all in one while reading.The story starts out showing their physical attraction for each other, and although there wasn't any physical interaction towards the end, it was so, so, so, so worth it, especially how the author chose to layout the story. I kid you not, when Dorian and Demitra finally came together, earth shattering, doesn't even come close to describing what took place between both Dorian and Demitra at Dorian's apartment. What made it even more exciting, you know it's forbidden.Dorian decides to do a favor for a family friend that works within the company. To hire his daughter as an intern.

"Move over male heroes - Tilda takes over!  Fantasy at its best - Mr. McNally leads us into a world that never lets up the pace and keeps the reader's interest right up to the end.  Although I found the manuscript a little long, it was extremely well crafted and one in which I found myself totally immersed.  Fantasy becomes believable in the characters and situations.  Be sure to read this book - it's one that will keep you reading right until the last page and leave you wanting more!",4.0

I've had this book on my &#34;to-read&#34; list for quite some time.  I didn't realize it was so short otherwise I would have read it long ago.

"This book is all about motivation, what it is, and what drives it.  It starts out with a brief explanation of reasons why people are unmotivated and reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t succumb to those reasons.There is then a chapter on how to determine what your excuses for procrastination are.My favorite part of the book is the section that lists things that can help you become more motivated. This includes music, looking your best, and even spirituality.There is also information on setting goals, holding yourself accountable for reaching those goals, and also suggestions on how to reach those goals, whatever they may be.I would recommend this book for people that often lack motivation and would like to do something about that. It would also be great for people that want to make sure that their motivation stays high, so they are able to accomplish their future goals.",5.0
"If you are into recipes, this is your book.Me? I hate cooking. I fell for this because of the 3 Ingredient Plant Based part of the title. I am, for the most part a vegan who is gluten-free and must watch my sugar and fat intake. This book didn't give me 3 ingredients ever. I was very confused by that. In fact, if I followed this diet I would violate nearly all my diet restrictions.I liked reading about the author's lifestyle. Having raised chickens, ducks and goats on an acre no-kill 'farm' and greenhorn at gardening, I loved reading about how it is supposed to be done. I so miss living in the country where I could have all those animals. I did eat the eggs and milked the goats. But I haven't been able to eat eggs for a long time. Maybe there are too many hormones and the like in the grocery store eggs.As for the rest of the book, I found the author repeated herself in the set up. The part that is about the problem at hand and how she has the answer. That got old for me. Then came the many recipes involving lots of ingredients that are not available for me, or that I can't eat. Some do look delicious, though.",3.0
"This is an interesting recap On the theories of near death experiences.  The author does not consider them theories, but fact.

This single does not contain a lot that is new, but is still an interesting account.",4.0

"What if Cinderella was a werewolf? And so was the Prince? And the Stepmother was not only Wicked but Insane? This is not the Cinderella story your Daddy told you &#8211; unless your dad was a cross between Stephen King and H. P. Lovecraft.The heroine is Loupe and as the Cinderella character she is used and abused, far beyond the usual scrubbing floors and waiting on the Stepsisters. [Since this is werewolf story, naming the heroine &#8216;Loupe&#8217; is a bit of tell.] She was bitten by a dying wolf which began her secret life as a loup garou and further complicated her situation. She fears her secret being revealed, she fears what she might do as a wolf, and she especially fears her Stepmother who has made a career out of poaching wolves out of the King&#8217;s forest&#8230; Despite her fears Loupe exhibits warmth and courage under adversity.The Prince is Etienne, a lycanthrope [born werewolf as opposed to the loup garou who are made werewolves], who was &#8216;saved&#8217; by a well-meaning witch. At least she thought she was saving him by putting a spell on him to make him permanently human. The spell is time-sensitive so to break it he must be bitten by a loup garou before he becomes permanently human. To find one they plan the great ball&#8230;Of course we all know how the ball worked out, only this time rather than turning back into a scullery maid the heroine turns into a wolf&#8230; Of course, she&#8217;s the wolf of the prince&#8217;s dreams AND the cure for his not-so-little problem so it&#8217;s all good.It&#8217;s a good read with a few light-hearted moments and several exceedingly grim ones. Although this is basically a stand-alone novel, the opening line of the prologue - &#8220;The werewolf, the vampire, the demon, the angel, and the god. Oh, Blessed Goddess, I have my work cut out for me.&#8221; - makes it obvious that it is part of a series based on preternatural princes making their perfect matches. Looks good, I am anticipating the next one.Copy received from Netgalley and publisher for an honest review.",5.0

I had to wait a few hours before I could write this revue as I really did not know what to feel when I finished the book - was it frustration? anger? sorrow? for how she was treated or admiration for Mia and her courage.

"My best friend Kate, has taken anti-depressants for many years. She has seen doctor after doctor to try and find out why she needs this medication.In reading this book I learned more about helping her than in many years past.Since it was doctor diagnosed, it should be doctor fixed. Made sense to me. This wonderful book teaches you different.Kate and I have begun to put to the test a few of the methods described in How To Be Happy. They have produced laughter and activity we were missing out on just a few days ago.Sadly no doctor ever told her that laughter acts as a tranquilizer and a mood enhancer.I wish I would have know how to help my best friend years ago. It has been a wonderful experience to see her come out of that deep dark place she has been in, even on medication, for so long. This book has changed both our lives for the better and I could not be happier. Don&#8217;t think you have to have a sad friend to benefit from this book. You are given ways of making a happy life even happier. You are inspired by the confidence that is instilled into you to know you can help others with just a simple smile, even if you are not aware of it!",5.0
"Loved the smart, strong and feisty detectives, Alex and Maggie.  Definitely a lesbian romance with all the elements a lesbian reader is looking for ... survival against the odds, tension, integrity, conflict, kindness, love, love-making, relationship-building, family and happy endings.  Especially loved Lyn Gardner's dialogue. She seems to have a real feel for how two women discovering themselves and each other might talk to one another.  One of the better edited lesbian novels.

(Soften up his image and strengthen her's.) But the lines between what's for show and what's real blurr when Zoe's life is endangered.I thought this was a decent, quick romance read. I liked both characters and their chemistry was good. I thought the story was interesting enough. Rory is a alpha male who has put work first too much and Zoe is trying to find her place outside of his world.

"Can a simple midnight breakfast after a rescue change all that, can a chance meeting two broken souls?There are times when you pick up a book and expect to get one thing and you get another. Usually you expect a great read to be left wanting. This is not the case here at all. I had City Knight on my Nook for a bit, always intending to read it, I do love a good Rent Boy story, but last night I finally did. What I expected was a good read before bed, what I got? What I got was me in tears at 2% into the book and literally hugging myself to get through the few paragraphs of back stories for these men. 2% in...there is only one other author out there who has set me on my ass as firmly. Mr. Webb, you are in mighty fine company on my shelf.City Knight is a short read, only 50 pages in length but what the author delivers is nothing short of brilliance. You are instantly drawn into the characters of Ben and Marcus. You get to know them within a few pages; you want to know more about them, about their past that has left them broken and you want them to heal.Ben is a college student, working nights to pay his way through school. Marcus is an ex-cop, keeping a promise to make his neighborhood safe. On a cold night when things turn bad, the men meet face to face in the darkness and in each other look to find a light.I won't go into much detail about the story, it's too short for that and, well, I don't do the whole spoiler deal but...Let me gush a minute about the writing of this story, it's simply fantastic. There is no telling the reader what they are going to feel, you are sucked in from the first word and you are there. You feel it; the cold, want, hurt, loss and longing. The words flow freely off the page and into your soul. There aren't many books that I can say that about. Sure, there are book that make you feel but to get so much emotion in very little pages...that folks is talent. I am in awe, my jaw is on the floor after reading this for a few reasons but the beauty of words strung together to make my heart race, yeah...this is a work of art.""He snapped out of his reverie when a cold hand grasped his, fingers curling around his palm. Marcus looked up, surprised, into a knowing gaze. The kid's eyes were gentle, all that hot anger and spice gone and replaced with kindness and...understanding. He let the moment stretch on, only because there was no trace of pity or sympathy and Benjamin - he couldn't call anyone who gave him this without asking questions kid now - squeezed once more before leaning back.""Marcus and Ben, their stories are heart wrenching, their meeting is special and their story is just beginning. I have to say, this is a MUST READ BOOK. Regardless of gender of the main characters, this writing is something that should not be missed.",5.0
"This was a sweet & easy to read story.  It was a bit too short.  I was close to giving it 4 stars but something about the ending didn't seem right.Wyatt returns home after 12 years to his family.  He runs into Paige, his best friend in high school.  He promised to take her with him when he left but he blew town and never called or contacted her.  He returns, his mom is the only happy person to see him.  He tries to set the record straight about a car accident when he was 18 years old between him & his brother which was the reason he left town.  this was the reason the whole town thinks he is a bad boy and the reason he left home never to look back.  This was the better part of the story, Wyatt trying to set the record straight.  Once you hear Wyatts side, his fathers side and his older brother Jay side, there were a lot of emotions and I honestly felt bad for all 3 of them.  This had a lot of potential to be a nice novel.What I didn't like was I felt no passion between Wyatt and Paige.  Yes they said they once had a crush on each other and yes they shared a kiss, but then next thing you know she is asking him to move back home.  Then it ended with a HEA but there was no passion felt, no sweep you off your feet, lovemaking, no romance.  No past emotions came into play.  This is why I am giving it 3 stars.  I will keep my eye out for the rest of the series and hope the following books are longer.",3.0
"After their battle in the castle near Perpignon, Txema (Chee-ma) Ybarra and her five vampire protectors are seeking a safe haven. Txema's life has not been in her own control since the night she woke up in her University of Tennessee dorm room to find a vampire standing over her. That had been the beginning of what the world now refers to as the infamous ""Knoxville Tragedy"". (Story told in the previous title, The Vampires' Last Lover.) Txema is the last of a bloodline that is vital in keeping an entire breed of vampires from deteriorating into an army of Nosferatu-like vampires.Thanks to a recent ceremony, Txema is pregnant. During the early stage of the pregnancy, Txema and her vampire protectors are guests at the Palace of Xu Zheng in the Himalayas. However, the army of the demon vampire, Ralu Izcacus, has grown. Bent on wiping out Txema's heritage, Ralu has stepped up his attacks and his mercenaries seem to be everywhere. The aggressive attacks result in Txema having to be whisked away from her Chinese hosts and into seclusion until her daughter, Alaia (A-lee-yah), is born.Ralu will not be satisfied until he takes over the entire world. The only threats to Ralu's full conquest of all vampires and human beings are Txema and Alaia. Ralu's forces openly chase Txema and Alaia all over the globe, killing humans and vampires alike. All major countries, and many small ones, are already under Marshall Law until the ""Chupacabra menace"" is over.Amid all of the violence and craziness going on in her life, Txema's undead protectors are doing all they can to keep mother and daughter safe, while trying to inject as much happiness as possible into their chaotic lives. Though unable to visit her parents, Txema soon has the comfort of Racco de Saint Germain's company. But Txema is unsure about resuming a relationship with the immortal, especially since it could be a distraction when her focus must remain fully on the care of her daughter. And speaking of Alaia, she is developing at almost three times the speed of a normal human, physically and mentally. There are signs of Alaia having a telepathic connection with Txema, as well as possible advanced cognitive abilities.It is up to Txema's small group of allies to stay at least one step ahead of the demon vampire's welling forces, in hopes that Alaia may someday become the catalyst that heals the growing conflict between humans and vampires.**** FOUR STARS! As with the first book in this series (The Vampires' Last Lover) this story is written much like a journal or memoir. Txema is the author/narrator. As the story opens, Txema explains that she and her group are still fighting for their lives. This book picks up from where the last one left off and will tell (any future reader of her memoir) what has happened up until Txema's current point in time.The previous book/memoir covered the first two weeks of Txema's surreal adventure. This time many months are covered. Because there are months during Txema's pregnancy when nothing happens to move the plot along, Txema's writing sticks to the biggest events instead of detailing every hour or every single day. Personally, I like this. As the reader, I am not forced to wade through pages or chapters of ""fluff"" and ""filler"". The last book of this trilogy will be titled ""Blood Princesses of the Vampires"" and currently has a release date set in October 2011.Unlike the first story, there are no scenes that are too steamy or intimate. Txema does not come across as loose and she still has her trademark sarcastic disposition. Having a child seems to have matured the character a bit. Aiden James tosses a few twists and surprises to keep readers off balance. The author also injects some well known television tidbits to make the story more realistic, such as when Txema mentions missing ""True Blood"", of which I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season Four. Do not worry about cliff-hanger endings. Though this story does not tie up all loose strings, it comes to a halt at a very good spot. If nothing else, I have learned that anything that comes from the imagination of Aiden James is sure to be interesting, suspenseful, and delightfully demonic. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.",4.0

"I read these stories as separate novellas before this boxed set was available and I really enjoyed them. These are sweet contemporary romances that are also fun and sexy stories. I liked the characters and the chemistry between them. I felt for them and was satisfied with the endings. One of the stories really is reminiscent of Cinderella so I see where the author got the name for the boxed set.

"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. While reading what it was about I figured typical, the guy will seek revenge, he'll fall back in love with her, and everything will be alright.OF course I was right but it was so much more than that. Lukas and Jasmine had met a few months ago and basically love at first sight happened. They had a whirlwind romance and gotten married. But thanks to a decision to be separated right after their wedding due to business, a critical accident, an interfering father, and amnesia Jasmine doesn't remember Lukas and anything about their relationship. She knows she's married but she's confused why he has left her. Did she leave him? Did something happened? ALl she knows is that when she wears her rings she's calmer and knows something is missing.Lukas is planning his revenge. Jasmine hurt him in the worst way possible and her father loved shoving it in his face. Now months have gone by and he wants what's his and then to get his revenge. However there is a few details he doesn't fully think about. WHat happens if she actually has amnesia? and what happens when everything he thought was true wasn't? That is why you need to read this book. It was seriously heart gripping and hard to put down.",5.0
"A last minute impromptu stop here turned out to be a life-changing experience.  The cases are filled with tempting treats, including cupcakes, cakes, pastries, cookies, and more.  We ordered a sugar cookie, a scone, a cupcake, a blondie, and a meringue cookie.  The sugar cookie was in the shape of a unicorn and tasted delightfully buttery and not too sweet.  The scone was packed with dried fruit and had just the right amount of crispness and richness.  The cupcake was a rendition of hot chocolate (their flavors range from ordinary to quirky to truly original).  The frosting actually tasted like a steaming mug of hot chocolate, while being light and fluffy at the same time.  The cake was one of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted.  Super light and yet very chocolatey.  I don't find cupcakes I like very often, as I find most of them to be sickeningly sweet, chemical-laden, or just lacking in flavor and texture.  This one was truly a standout and I enjoyed every bite.  I gave the lime cheesecake blondie to a friend and will inquire about its merits, but based on everything else we sampled, my guess is that it is on par.  The final selection, a purple and blue swirled meringue cookie (appropriately called ""unicorn poop"") was exactly right.  Even though I'm hardly ever in that neighborhood, I was so pleased with the quality of the food and the adorable storefront that I will make an effort to return, hopefully time and time again.

"Jocelynn Drake gives us our first look into her new Urban Fantasy world of the Asylum Tales with this engaging novella. Our main character is Gage, a tattoo artist and wielder of magic, who shares his story in the first-person.  It all begins as he wakes up on the floor of a nasty bar bathroom, shaking off the effects of a mickey.He soon discovers he was drugged by his own friend, an incubus named Parker, who dosed him so he could go, er, recharge his energies.  A troll named Bronx helps him track down his wayward friend. After too many drinks together, the three of them engineer a misguided plan to give Parker a magical tat to help him get the energies he needs without having to cheat on his girl.  Things only go downhill from there.I liked the story.  The world-building is clear and easy to understand... and incorporated seamlessly into the storytelling.  Even in roughly 60 pages, Drake gives us a clear look at her protagonist and the ongoing problems he will face as he struggles to suppress his magical urges and duck the close eye of the Ivory Tower council.I look forward to getting to know him better and I hope we see more of secondary characters Parker and Bronx. I have a feeling we're in for a fun ride with this series.Rating: B+",4.0

"I was looking for somewhere new to grab dinner and a beer when I'm too lazy to cook, and read about this new Fishtown spot via Twitter.  Suddenly what I really wanted was a burger and a scotch.  I decided to trek through the first snow/sleet/nastiness of the season to check it out.

After reading up on the brand new bar, I was hoping for ""Village Whiskey, Fishtown Edition"" and that is exactly what I got.  No, they don't have 50 single malt scotches on the menu.  But the do have close to 10, at a big discount from Village Whiskey's prices.  And they have my personal favorite scotch -- Laphroaig 10yr -- which I enjoyed with an excellent burger. (It's not really fair to compare to the Village Whiskey burger, which is arguably the best burger in the city, so I won't.)

Overall, my first visit was excellent, and I will most likely find myself there again every time someone I've shared a drink with at Village Whiskey is in my neighborhood.",4.0
I was hoping for a bit more in the story department at times I felt as if I was only being told part of the story. The characters are likable and I thought the romance was hot but the ending kind of fell flat too me because it was to predictable. oh well maybe Ms. Dubois will expand on the series and give us a little more action and adventure and less inner monolgue,3.0

"I am a relatively new fan of Carrie Ann Ryan and have been waiting for Adam and Bay's story from the fist Redwood Pack's book and I was not let down! This book was such a tear jerker, full of emotion, anger, battles and above all true love. I never give a story away but this one was so worth the wait I cant even begin to tell you how much I loved it. I bought and read it in one day-it was that engaging. I will no doubt be re-reading it to make sure I did not miss anything! Cant wait until the next book in this series!",5.0

"Near death when rescued, Noah has spent the past six months recovering from his year long ordeal.  He was caged, brutalized, and assaulted on a regular basis by the Raven who made Noah call him Master. Noah still can't sleep most nights.  It doesn't really help his morale either to be treated with kid gloves by his entire family, plus he knows intuitively that they are keeping information from him.Seth still recalls the night he kicked in the cage door and found the young jaguar shifter beaten half to death.  He carried Noah to safety and remembers how perfectly he felt in his arms.  A connection was made that awful night, somehow felt by both and never forgotten, no matter how long they've been apart.As brother to the shifter coalition leader and part of a large shifter family, Noah should feel something besides constant isolation and loneliness. Yet, Noah has never felt more alone.  Could it be that everyone knows of his past? How he survived on the streets or is it the treatment by his captor that makes them shy away?  It seems to Noah that nobody will ever love him, especially a tall, hot tiger shifter named Seth.A perfect balance of steamy romance and heartbreaking perseverance, A Wicked Caress is memorable.  Book five in the Lost Shifters series, A Wicked Caress has just enough back story to put this tale in proper perspective for new readers without boring the many, many fans.  Noah's life has been a tragedy, but he's a true survivor while Seth has also dealt with personal anguish.  These two are meant to heal each other, together.  There is a strong sensual element that tantalizes the senses as well.  A Wicked Caress is an erotic adventure certain to please readers.  My only regret is that there's only one missing brother left to find. I don't want this series to end.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",5.0
I really loved this book!!  I had a hard time putting it down once I started it. I enjoyed the first book in the series but I enjoyed this one so much more. Zoe is one of my favorite book heroines! She was such a strong character and wasn't afraid to say what was on her mind. I did get a little irritated with Alex and the back & forth stuff. I could kinda see why he was doing what he was but it still irritated me. I love that these two characters got their HEA and can't wait to read the next book in the series. I hope we get more Alex and Zoe.I received a free copy if this book in exchange for an honest review.,4.0

"This is a very good short story. The stage is set well, but quickly. The children only have themselves to rely on, their parents only seem to regard them as household staff. Then you have the house next door, where the owner has recently died. A well respected teacher, who, nevertheless doesn't seem to have had anyone that close to him.

"I liked the premise of this story, which was about a boy from Thailand who has to leave his homeland.  The story could have been better though, perhaps if it were shorter and had an element of surprise or suspense.  Basically, the point of this tale was to encourage children to be thankful for friendships, even if they have to leave a person or an animal friend behind.  So it would be best for young kids who are dealing with issues related to moving and making new friends.",3.0

"While I am enjoying the book and am only in the earliest chapters I've decided to go ahead and write a review.  I believe I will enjoy reading all of this book but I feel compelled to write this review now instead of later.  This is the first illustrated book I've read since See Spot Run and my very reason for reading is escapism.  You see, when I read a book and the characters are described I can conjure up in my mind what the H/h look like and sound like...by having illustrations of the main characters I'm reading the author's ideal character and not my own.  I don't mind the shots that don't include the faces of the H/h but really despise photos of the characters themselves.  in fact, in an earlier illustration I believe the one where the heroine's head is supposed to be wrapped...the photo itself looks like the hero instead of the heroine.  I was reading The Richmond Rogues series several months ago and there were an assortment of baseball players that were in every book of the series.  Although I am too lazy to look up the series now I can remember that one of the main characters, in my mind, was described in such a way that all I could picture this man looking like was Johnny FairPlay from Survivor...not a great hero, however, there were personality quirks this ball player as well as the author's description that for me lead me to imagining Johnny FairPlay and by the end of the series I actually liked him.  If I read a western romance, for some reason, regardless of the character's description I hear Sam Elliot's voice.  I find the illustrations are ruining this book for me...I will finish this book and probably like it, but I would never buy another book from any author that is illustrated..your heros are your heros please let me imagine my own.....well unless you can get Keanu Reeves or Ian Sommerhalder to pose for you...lolOkay, I'm editing because I've finished the book...it took me 11 hours straight, watched the sunrise this morning and while I still hated the illustrations, I MUST say I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book.  After 741 pages I still didn't want it to end.  however there are still some unanswered questions for me....Gideon found similarities between his mother and Francine, which made me wonder if his own mother travelled thru time...also it's a stretch to list this as a time travel genre...Just because I can sew on a button it doesn't necessarily mean I can sew.  So just because Francine/ Madeline switched time zones at least from this story for me this wasn't a true time travel series...but that's fine because this book was just so damn good.  If you published your grocery list I would probably buy it and read it...lol but I'm hoping against hope you're not done with this series..well done Ms Leblanc.",4.0

"By Surprise is a wonderful m&eacute;nage story. There is something to love about all three of these people. This is one that takes an existing couple and adds in a third person without it seeming a bit crazy.Paxton wanted to do something really special for his husband Nicholas's birthday, so he offers to have a threesome with a woman knowing that Nicholas can't just stop being a bisexual because they got married. But before that big event can happen the rug gets pulled out from Paxton. He loses his job, and has to deal with the possibility of them losing their house that he loves.Nicholas goes on a grocery run for a special dinner, and the last thing he expects in the world is to run into Jodi his best friend from childhood that left with a chunk of his heart 10 years ago. After finding out about her struggles since moving home after her divorce, the guys ask her to move in with them. As Nicholas and Jodi renew their friendship, the unexpected turn comes when Paxton starts to have feelings for Jodi as well. Can these guys who are very happy in their marriage add Jodi in without ruining what they have already built?I have said in the past that MMF is my favorite genre, and I always love to see new takes on how they come about. To add in a person that has a history with one of the peeps in the main couple can be a recipe for disaster if not handle correctly by everyone in the threesome. This one was handled beautifully for the length of the book. This is one of those really great quick reads. I highly recommend this one to you guys!Review copy provided for an honest review.",4.0
"I really liked most of this book but I felt that it could have ended at around 60%.I ended up skimming most of the parts with Bobby because I felt it wasn't detrimental to the book and just added length.There was way too much going on. The main character made a ton of bad decisions. There was way too much drama for me, 500+ pages worth.I felt like most of the story could have been cut out and it would have been much better and less of an anxious rollercoaster.",3.0

"I enjoy learning about parts of history that you don't normally hear a lot about.  Sure, the ""big"" historical touchstones are important and interesting, but there's so much more that you or I have no idea went on in the world.Take Jeanne Mariette Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Nguy&#7877;n H&#7919;u Th&#7883; Lan, for example.  She was the first woman to marry a king of Vietnam in 140 years, that rose above the title of ""Primary Imperial Concubine"", to ""Queen"", before the death of her husband.  She was a very motivated and charismatic woman, that drew fascination and respect wherever she went.While it is primarily a historical piece, there is a lot regarding women's empowerment, as well.  She overcame the ""hurdle"" of being a woman in Vietnam, to be a powerful and important figure, that we - both women and men - can all learn something from today.",5.0
The story was pretty boring and I found myself skimming pages. The main girl really drove me nuts... she was over the top stubborn and just rude at times. This is not an erotica book if that's what you're looking for. Quick Read (like 2 hours tops)really should only be .99 book.,1.0
"I'll See You In My Dreams by Sable HunterZane and PresleyWell, I'm sorry to say that this was not my favorite book in the series... but it was good none-the-less!  I guess I could chalk it up to this book not being about one of the McCoys... I'm spoiled that way... just can't get enough of them!!!!  Although Zane is hot, he's not a McCoy soooooo, I'll just say this... He's definitely one fine blind man!!!  I do love the twists this story takes with new characters, danger to old characters, and the future of the McCoys!!!  Can't wait to read the next installment!!!  I must say that the feeling of ""bullying"" in this story was breaking my heart... I'm one of those people that always came to the rescue of the meek and mild and the ridicule and nasty things said to Presley were making me wanna beat the crap out of someone!!!  I just can't get over how such small minded people can make such an impact on someone's life just with words alone!!!Zane is your typical hunka munka on the outside... but his heart is as big as the state of Texas!!!  Although he's only been blind for 5 years, he's honed in on his other senses quite nicely!!  He's good with animals and people... always giving back to those less fortunate than him, even though he's been plagued with blindness, it doesn't stop him in anyway!!  Now Presley... oh that poor little girl!  All her life.. what an upset... so beautiful, so smart, so caring, and so wounded!!  I can't believe that crap filled trenches this girl had to go through to get where she is today... but as the saying goes, that which does not kill you makes you stronger!!!  She nearly broke my heart just reading and watching this story unfold... I wanted to hug her like a million times!!!  Glad to see the McCoy's brought back even though it was in a sad way!!!  Can't wait to see where that story leads!!!I've been reading one book about 1 1/2 days, but since I hosted our late family Christmas this past weekend... I got a little behind!!  This one too me 4 days... not to say that it was hard to read, just had to put my focus on other things!!  Although this in not my favorite book in the series, it was still good!  It was everything I hoped it would be and more, just left me feeling a little wanting... I'm sure glad this book opened up an new doorway into a whole new set of possible books, because I'm gonna need my McCoy fix on a regular basis!!At about 50% (kindle version) I was feeling a little lost, like the story was gonna end on me and I was worried, but like I said before, this book is the gateway into a whole new set of books/stories to come... Ms. Hunter is definitely NOT done with the Hell Yeah series by far... so hold on to your panties cause there's a ton more hotties to come!!!  Although it ended on sort of a cliff hanger, you can rest assured you'll feel complete after reading this book!!!4 stars!!",4.0

"My wife and I went to Zeppoli for our Anniversary on 9/13/14 and we were anxious to go because of all the great reviews. To say the least, we were not disappointed the food and wait staff were excellent! The bread and olive oil sent out before the meal was delicious. We had the Pesto Trapanese (Sicilian style fusilli pasta with almond-pistachio pesto) for an appetizer and it was great we both enjoyed it very much.

  For entrees my wife had Rigatoni alla Disgraziata (Mezze rigatoni with eggplant, tomato, ricotta salata and basil-breadcrumbs) which was fantastic. I had the 
Bistecca Enna (Marinated rib-eye steak served with arugula and tomato salad ) which was unbelievable and probably the best steak I have ever had. To finish we ordered the Cannoli Classico for dessert and it was a great finish to a fantastic experience.                
   
  Lastly, a lot of reviews about the small dining area and noise level being moderate are correct, however, it didn't in any way take away from the incredible food experience and professional, friendly staff. Zeppoli was easily one of the best restaurants we have ever eaten at and will definitely be returning.",5.0

"This was a quick read that I found sweet and light. There wasn't much steam at all, however you could feel the chemistry between Abby and Stephen and the lack of heavy drama was a nice change of pace from what is out there today. Stephen was a little harder to get a read on, however I loved Abby. She had a real strong personality and I enjoyed reading from her POV. It was a very quick read, and I think when I say I wish there had been more and other reviewers say it, it should be taken as a compliment. I would have loved to see more interaction between them, and maybe a bit more in the way of flirting.

"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Oil and Corruption by Gareth Flood.  Flood laid it all out for us to get a glimpse of what the Oil business can and probably is like in a sense.  The none stop action that you experience in the day-to-day life of Jonathan was amazing.  I ended up rooting for him the entire novel from beginning to end.  Flood has a way of giving you just enough details to think you know how Jonathan's life will turn out and then he springs a surprise or new player into the mix that makes you second guess what you thought you knew.  Oil and Corruption gives the reader plenty of action, a smidge of comedy and a little romance thrown in here and there.  Like I stated I really enjoyed this read, didn't want to put it down. I am definitely a converted fan of Gareth Flood; looking forward to many more projects.The cover of this novel lets you know the is going to be a book of action. The multitude of flags represented shows is going to be a global issue, the masked man shows its probably going to be hush hush or secret.  I do appreciate that the cover is in color; there are so many interpretations that can be perceived from the collage of images presented.",4.0

"Carrying on from where book 1 left off and I must say the story had a nice flow into this book. In fact this book flowed much better than the first book.It still had it&#8217;s little dictionary ditty at the start of each chapter but I found the whole book to be much better written. The interview and the conversations and flashbacks etc were much smoother. This book didn&#8217;t jump around like the first book and so was an easier read.I enjoyed this book, finding out what the big secret was, that we spent the whole of book 1 wondering about.Basically two people who had absolutely no reason to trust each other yet couldn&#8217;t stay away from each other was an interesting angle on a coupling. Normally trust is the first thing you need in a relationship, but there was none between these two!A nice conclusion to a nice story.I thought the author did a good job pulling the whole story together and she also seemed to change POV much smoother between chapters.I would recommend these books.",4.0

"First, if you haven't read any of the Jet books yet, get started.  The original is still free on Amazon, and the rest just keep getting better and better.  I have read everything Russell Blake has published, and the Jet series is his best work among a boatload of gems.While the climax may be slightly predictable, nothing leading up to that point is, and the chapters after the climax certainly take you on an unexpected path.  If you can read this book and not be irriated that there isn't a Jet VI yet, good luck.  The action is non-stop, and the writing/flow is top-notch.  Hard to review fully without giving away the plot, but if you are an action novel fan, you will love this book.And Finally, Mr. Blake, how can you have an ending like this, and have on your website that the next book in the series won't be out for another 8 months?

This is an emotionally charged well written portrayal of a couple faced with a tragedy and the secrets that could destroy them.

"It was a toss up between three and four stars.  This author has the potential to be truly great.  This is the first book that I have read by her and, I have to say, I was equally enthralled and disgusted.  I know that there are three other books but their blurbs did not appeal to me like this one did.I don't generally judge a book by its cover but this cover is bad....really bad.  This cover suggests that the main character is a drag queen being stalked by a man that he/she knows.  Or, perhaps, she is a woman by day and a man by night...if you factor in the mirror.  The cover really should be changed.The main characters were so intriguing. Syn, a thief with a heart but who is also a very practical survivor.  Jorden, a highborn lady with a secret.  I was very interested in them but the author just didn't do them justice.  The potential was there but the execution was lacking.  I love that the book was written in the third person and there was no perspective flipping as seen in first person novels.I think, had the author focused on the main characters of this novel rather than the main characters of her previous novels, that this book would have been the best lesbian romance I have read to date.

"Grade: A- (5 stars)Steampunk fantasy is an amazing genre! I personally read The first book by this author earlier, in my free time, i never got around to reviewing it. When i got a chance to read the second book I was all excited. It&#8217;s a great story, the world is created so well you can get lost in it, its wonderful. These a lot of conflict in this book, as the main character is currently imprisoned when we begin. Synn is such a great character. He&#8217;s brave, true and just trying to figure out how to do the right thing for his people. He&#8217;s so fleshes out, I really felt for him and his struggles in this book. He takes on so much, the Families, the Queens, all for his people. He&#8217;s a true hero. All the other characters in this novel were also wonderful, it&#8217;s nice to see an author who takes her time on all the characters, not just the main ones. This book was just as good as the first one, if not better in my opinion. It&#8217;s a lovely story, with action and sadness and struggle.  It&#8217;s got everything, and it really grabs you and holds tight. I loved it!* i was given a copy in exchange for an honest review  .",5.0

"I recently read another book by this author - A Ripple in Time and absolutely loved it so I was keen to see if this book was as good. Well I'm happy to say Julia Hughes has only gone and done it again and created a fast-paced, witty, character driven tale that had me enthralled from the first page. I don't think I have ever read a book where one of the main characters has been an alligator, Alfie, no less! The author clearly has an absolute gift for creating unusual, unique, yet totally believable plots. It was an added bonus I was already familiar with the hero of the tale, the unpredictable, yet loveable Wren, his girlfriend Carrie and cousin Rhyllann - the three unlikely musketeers. This book is full of thrills and spills, villains aplenty and Police officer Crombie, the long suffering subject of much taunting from the cousins and yet undeniably he is an integral spoke in this wheel of murder and mystery. With the perfect balance of action and humour this tale culminates in a dramatic climax.I am definitely going to be adding Julia Hughes to my list of favourite authors and will be downloading the first book from this series A Raucous Time very soon.",5.0

This book by Adam Pearson is a quality product.  It's extremely well-written and is very thorough.  One thing I especially liked is that the author discussed potential earnings in a realistic way.  The book goes through all of the steps of researching and creating an e-book, publishing the book on Kindle or other platforms and promoting the book through reviews and other methods.  He also discusses how to best collect royalties and list some alternatives to individual account publishing like S-Corps.  The author also covers other publishing platforms besides Kindle like Smashwords, CreateSpace and many more.If you know anyone who wants to pursue e-book publishing in any form I would highly recommend this book!

"Come Pour the Wine is a romance novel that follows Janet through her new life in New York and how she finds love. The story is told in third in person through a few characters, but mainly Janet. When the story begins (in the 1950s), Janet is a young girl who leaves her family in Kansas to pursue a modeling career in New York.  With a rough start, Janet soon finds some friends and connections to home. Not long after, she meets Bill through a mutual friend, and falls head over heels in love. However, love is not an easy road for Janet and Bill. The book spans about 20 years of Janet&#8217;s life in New York.This story was not one that I&#8217;d normally pick up. [I usually like romance novels that have something else going on besides normal life events &#8211; if that makes sense.] The era 1950s-1970s was fairly new for me, although I read stories set in that time period. I never read a book with subtle Jewish connections to it. [On a side note: I have seen the TV show The Nanny, and it was neat to see how to spell some of those Jewish sayings. Obviously, I&#8217;m not Jewish!] The writing read smoothly&#8212;although I didn&#8217;t care for the jumps in character perspectives without warning. It would make me pause a moment while reading to put myself in the other character&#8217;s mind. I don&#8217;t mind having different views, but I would have been easier if there were distinct breaks to separate them.Despite the jumps, the different perspectives helped the reader to understand what the other characters were thinking &#8211; adding more depth to the story. I never really saw what Janet saw in Bill. But, perhaps that was just me. Kit was an interesting character and one of my favorites. I thought she brought a little oomph to the story. The plot itself tied in themes about family/marriage, Jewish and religious connections, finding oneself, and love. It told a story about the normal challenges couple might face. The book was a fairly quick read and overall I liked it.",4.0

"I first came across Mark Capell when I won a giveaway for his book, VOWS TO KILL, over at LibraryThing earlier this year. I really enjoyed it and I couldn't wait to read more of his work. When he asked if I'd review CAF&Eacute; INSOMNIAC I couldn't say no! Capell's CAF&Eacute; INSOMNIAC is an intricate mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Justin Brooks is looking forward to the next chapter in his life. Suffering from insomnia, he decides to open an all night caf&eacute; and serve people looking for a great cup of coffee. On opening night, he gets a visit by a man who tells him to call him should he need any help and Justin dismisses him from his mind. As the night progresses, he serves less than a handful of customers and keeps tabs on a woman who walks in and stays all night. The next morning, he finds out a caf&eacute; customer was murdered, but as the nights progress, he finds there's no one to trust and events around him become more and more strange. Justin soon finds himself at the center of an investigation and when his family is threatened, he realizes he needs to tread carefully.As for characterization, we get a good grasp of the characters and character development is strong. We spend the majority of our time with Justin and we get to experience firsthand how insomnia affects his life. It's easy to sympathize with Justin and you can feel his struggle with insomnia. Capell introduces several secondary characters that are vital to the plot. We have Delilah who makes terrible coffee, but is a gifted musician and she's there to help Justin run the caf&eacute;. Justin's father and his sister also make an appearance and it's easy to understand what the family dynamic is. Then there's our victim and I won't say the name because I don't want to spoil the story because the plot does revolve somewhat around this person's death. Finally, there's the mysterious Vince Moore who a property investor who has a shady past.Narration is first person via Justin's perspective and it's necessary for the reader to understand his struggle with insomnia. The writing is engaging and Capell is a solid storyteller. I really enjoyed how easy it was to imagine the scenes and everything taking place. CAF&Eacute; INSOMNIAC really comes to life and it's a rare treat to find an author with that talent. I did come across a few Britishisms that might confuse a reader not familiar with British culture, but nothing that will prevent a reader from enjoying and understanding the plot. He does make a reference to the Kray Brothers, notorious twin brothers who ran an organized crime operation in the East End of London. The brothers for the most part aren't widely known in the US, but have been referenced in a song by Jay-Z and Kanye. Anyway, I liked how Capell used the Moore brothers and fashioned them after the Kray brothers in way. It keeps the reader guessing as to the identity and what type of person Vince Moore is.Readers are left with a few questions unanswered, but nothing that will prevent you from enjoying it. The ending is beautifully done and I can't imagine it being any other way and it was a surprise! I apologize to my neighbors for yelling, ""Come on now!"" Like I said, it was a complete surprise that I wasn't expecting. Also, it's important to note that CAF&Eacute; INSOMNIAC takes place over the course of a week, but it feels longer than that. Part of has to do with the way Capell incorporates time and breaks it down according the day. If Justin felt the week of opening was a long one, you will too.Mark Capell's CAF&Eacute; INSOMNIAC will have you question what to believe: the facts in front of you or what your mind tells you.**This review appears on my blog**",4.0

This book is very little verbal interaction between the main characters and mostly environment descriptions, as well as, being in Ashley's head where you read over and over again how she can't forgive Jake.  I liked Jake and would have liked to read about why he really left her at the alter, but I am not interested in reading another book with so much description.",2.0

"The morphs are back! What silly people these morphs are to dress up in a long silky suit from head to toe--but wait, maybe not. As Fedora Fingerman (the main sleuth) tells us in this giggle-filled mystery, how great it is to not worry about makeup, your hair and what to wear? Fedora is member of the Cold Case Investigation Agency, along with her morph partners, Shadow and Fog. They get their first extremely cold case when Fedora befriends a long-dead ghost that only she can communicate with. When Fedora promises to help the ghost, things start to get interesting. Along the way the morphs have to deal with bombs, murder, mobster producers and a prankster ghost with a jealous streak. This all adds up to some silly giggles as these morphed private investigators get to the bottom of the craziness to solve the mysteries that pop up. As an extra bonus, splash in a little romance to spice things up here and there.Like all of Silkstone's books, this one flows well and reads fast. It is filled with funny scenes that are so easy to picture in your mind you will find yourself shaking your head while laughing out loud. Another slapstick funny and sweet romance for a relaxing afternoon read. Worth your time for sure!",4.0

"If &#8220;Can&#8217;t Shake You&#8221; is truly Molly McLain&#8217;s first book then all I can say is WELL DONE!This book was a joy to read from start to finish, I honestly have not written one negative thing in my notes.Josh was swoonworthy, tattooed and a soon-to-be ex-marine. Carissa is smart, sassy and not afraid to go after what she wanted, their friends and family likeable and easy to read. No major angst or off-the-charts sob stories. Just a group of people going about their lives in River Bend, and dealing with the problems that are thrown their way, I loved that they had a little history between them and we got too see glimpses of it as the story unfolds, there is also a little suspense thrown in just for good measure.This is the type of book, that when I have finished reading it, leaves me fluttery tingles in the bottom of my tummy. The flutters are for the excitement that I may have just discovered my next drop-everything-for-to-read-series, and the tingles are for that feeling you get when you know you have discovered an author that has the potential to blow you away with each and every book they release.What I loved about Can&#8217;t Shake You most is it&#8217;s the foundation stone in what I believe could be absolute series-gold, we are introduced to enough secondary characters in the book that there is potential for quite a few more to follow on.

"Joan Smith has a very unique writing style which combines first person narration and witty repartee with quirky but lovable characters. The H is never too macho and is always busy doing his duty to something which interferes with a romance. The h is intelligent, fiesty, intrepid, pretty-not beautiful. Smith avoids the usual ton balls and high society intrigue and sets her stage away from London and among the common man, usually in a rural setting.  Her humor alone defines this author as one of the absolute best in the genre. Her avoidance of graphic sex allows emphasis on story and character development and is much more reflective of the social norms of the times. Of its type, this is as good as it gets.",5.0

"The Blades of the Old Empire is the first book in the new Majat Code Series.  It is an epic fantasy that follows Kythan Dorn, a young prince with rare elemental magic, and his companions.  Kyth&#8217;s life changes forever when mysterious men from a cult was outlawed centuries ago attack him and his friends, and it turns out these men have strange powers of their own.  When the Kaddim cult realizes that their power works neither on Kyth or his Majat Warrior bodyguard Kara, Kyth and Kara end up at the top of the Kaddim&#8217;s hit list.  Kyth, his stepbrother Alder, and Kara go on a mission to find support from the grasslands, trying to avoid the schemes of the Kaddim along the way.  At the same time Kyth&#8217;s friend Ellah goes with his father and the Keepers, hoping to learn some of the Keeper healing secrets, and how to enhance her own ability to tell whether or not someone speaks the truth.  Unless Kyth and his father can get support from other leaders in the land, the church, which has been infiltrated by the Kaddim cult, will execute Kyth because of his powers and depose his father from the throne.I realize that this description of the plot sounds a bit convoluted, but the author plops the reader right down in the middle of the story, and it takes a while to discern what exactly is happening in the story.  This makes it hard to do a short description because I had very little backstory to explain before having to relate the setup of the plot. This is not necessarily a bad thing.  There are many amazing books like The Black Company or the Malazan books that put reader down in the middle of the action with little to no explaination.  Blades of the Empire is an enjoyable book, and once you get familiar with the characters and the setting, it is easy to route for the protagonists and against the antagonists.  The book is also a fast paced read, and it contains plenty of action.  The Majat Warriors in particular are very fascinating characters, and I would love to learn more about them in further books.  There are also many hints of an older, not quite extinct society, which could be expanded upon a lot more as the series goes on.  There is also an element of romance to this book, and I liked that it was tasteful and did not completely overwhelm the story line.  This book is action packed from the very first page, and is a good start to a series that I will look forward to reading more of.I would have enjoyed this book a bit more if there had been more world building.  The story went so fast that I did not feel immersed in the world, and I would have liked to be a little more familiar with each character.  The plotline was explained sufficiently, and after a while the plot was easy to follow, but it was not explained with the level of detail that I am partial to, or that I think most readers require to bring them into the story.Overall, this was an entertaining, but not completely engaging story.  The series does have a lot of potential, and I plan on reading the next book in the Majat Code series to see if there is more world building.  I would rate this book a 7/10.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley and the publisher in return for an honest review.",4.0

He always calls her kid since she's younger than him.Robin puts Drake on a pedestal and she's debased when he's not what she thought he was. Her emotions are all over the place.

She's been in Robin's shoes so she doesn't want her to get hurt like she did.Don't recommend this to anyone under the age of sixteen. I recommend it to older teens and adults.",4.0
"The price continues to  be attractive and the books are fast fun reads.  No deep thoughts hidden in these books though.More angels, archangels and dragons too.  This book is as good as most of the series, fun, fast escapism but do not think too much about it as some parts are a little bit of a stretch.  The handfast engagement continues.  Tabitha must be rescued from the goblins who kidnapped her.  The goblins have their own problems as dragons find them to be the best thing for snacking.  So it's off to the dragon realm to try and rescue Tabitha stop dragons eating intelligent goblins, resolve the hand fasting and perhaps straighten out an arch angel who keeps switching souls with Xandra.Little simplistic but just enjoy the story and don't think too hard and you will be fine.Spoiler AlertDragons like to eat goblins because they smell really bad.  Goblins are thinking beings and some of them raise others as slaves to feed the dragons.  This is not morally good.  Nobody has thought of replacing goblins with pigs or cows with goblin sweat and piss poured over them before?",3.0

"Visited Mr. B's on the last night of a bachelorette party. Walked in at 8pm with 5 people and were seated immediately. It is definitely a splurge, but well worth it. Between the 3 of us we ordered a moderately priced wine, 3 filet's (you can change around the side orders if you want. The potatoes and asparagus were awesome.) Another friend ordered the pork chop, which was about 5 inches thick, and came with a soy/ginger sauce. I wasn't impressed with the pork chop but the filet was a great size and excellent. Only thing I should have requested more of the sauce that came with it as it was great as well. This was a great dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back on my next NOLA trip.",5.0

"I like the idea-- man in drag, some straight guy, then he realizes he's actually gay or converts someone else. Actually, I will read anything with this concept. The plot was faintly ridiculous however. Maybe it was always going to be, but waiting for the cops to bust a house-wife organized pot ring was a bit much. But hey, I read romance so I would have let it go if the characters were good enough.But, I actually found it faintly unpleasant that our hero knew so little about the guy he was shacking up with. The love interest was so subdued that I wasn't sure what he felt. The author attempted to fix this at the end by having the character say something like, 'you didn't say much but your actions spoke for you.' Oh brother.Sex scenes were not bad, but it was no Grey's Awakening, lemme tell you.",3.0

"Once again Charlotte Boyett-Compo has amazed me with her writing of the Reapers series.  It took me no time to read this book as I was engrossed from the start and could not put the book down.  This is by far my favorite of the 4 books so far in this series.  There are twists and turns that you don&#8217;t expect, every time you think you know what might happen next the story is propelled in a different direction altogether.  The series is well thought out and with each story you start to feel more and more for each character as you get to know them.This story is about Owen and Rachelle and what a story it is.  Owen has already endured so much in his long life as a Reaper and what he must endure now is even more heartbreaking.  I have never felt a sadness as I did or such an overwhelming loathing for Morrigunia as I did in this book.  Even though she looks out for her Reapers she shows a side that is purely evil in this book.Rachelle is another story, what she has had to withstand is also just as heartbreaking.  I guess that is what makes her such an enduring character.  Hers and Owens love is strong and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the outcome is for their relationship.  There is an interesting twist at the end and I am truly looking forward to what happens next in this futuristic world.This is a series that I would highly recommend to anyone who likes this genre, I can&#8217;t put these books down.  They are well written and I am looking forward to the next one in the series.  To get the most of these books they should be read in order, none of them have disappointed me yet.*free copy gifted for honest review**originally reviewed for welovekink(dot)com",5.0

"I had read the reviews and had mixed feelings about getting this selection. The comments I read had positive remarks about the recipes. Just reading the recipes I find the proportions of seasonings to meat and vegetables to be overpowering. The combinations read well. I do plan to try some of these combinations but I will be adjusting amounts from the start. Some people like highly seasoned sauces so strong the wonderful flavors of the food does not come through. These recipes seem geared to that group of people. For those of us that prefer delicate flavorings to enhance the natural flavors of the food, these recipes are not for you.",1.0

I did like his sarcastic and challenging personality, specially at he beginning of the book when he is threatened by Jocelyn.

"I was really in the mood for a good Highland romance, or something to do with that sort of premise and theme. But this story definitely left me wanting. The elements might be there, but the writing is extremely amateurish, and just jumps around without ever really developing either characters or story. Even though I was perfectly willing to take the leap of fantasy and faith, there were too many mental chasms to cross over, and too little structure. I also really hated that the female protagonist was so aggressive in her rush to lose her virginity. It was pretty much of a turn off, and other than a guy's natural instincts to react in such a situation with a woman throwing herself at him, also simply pathetic. All in all, this book was a disappointing tease, and not worth the time or money.",2.0

The Piano Tutor was a delightful quick read. It was nice watching Diana Waverly grow as a person and come out of her shell.

"Similar in theme to several series that I've read, this first in a series Indie was surprisingly good.  It was written with a smooth and easy style, it didn't have an overabundance of proofreading errors, and it had lots of sexy romance.  It had numerous supernatural characters, some lighthearted humor, and a decent plotline.I would have liked it to be longer, and I wish that the Witch character Carmen had played a larger part in the story.  The Heroine's personality seemed a little rushed (unbelieving one page, too accepting of things on the next page).  She also seemed to 'forget' about her best friend on a regular basis.  The Hero should have had a little more brains to go along with his brawn.The ending was nicely resolved, and there are plenty of possibilities for upcoming stories.

I have so far only read a couple of the short stories and I was happily shocked to discover that I can read them without getting lost and frustrated.

I'm torn when it comes to the female characters that I read about. I love reading a good Dom and Sub relationship but on the other hand I also love reading about Strong don't tell me what to do females.

"I think this might partially be my fault...I keep feeling like these people should be/act like adults, forgetting they are like 18 years old.  However, I'm not sure that the author wants us to see them as teenagers as they have homes, cars, lives that 30 year olds are lucky to have been mature enough for so...who knows.  They are definitely ridiculously immature in round 2...Definitely not a bad book.  Probably close to 3.5 stars.  My only real issues with this book are with the H/h.  Seriously - how stupid are you to make the SAME mistake twice??  It's just annoying - maybe you deserve what you get...And for the other main character - it just seemed like psycho harsh what they do - sorry to be vague don't want to give too much away.  I understand the angst angle it just was a bit over the top - I honestly stopped liking Casey and just wanted to slap her for the last 25% of the book...I can't really rate a book that high when that happens.  I also thought they would mention her music talents and it doesn't really seem to happen really at all which was kind of annoying - I guess/hope that will be a big focus for book 3.However, I am definitely looking forward to the next book as I would like to find out what happens in this series so again, 3.5.",3.0

"** 3 1/2 Stars **Josh Faraday is a reporter that hides behind a faceless character, JR, in a popular newspaper column.  Upset that Tess Banyon has reached critical acclaim and high popularity, including her own television show, yet he can't get producers to launch his, Josh decides that Tess can't possibly be the perfect homemaking diva she portrays.  He figures out a way to infiltrate her domain in order to get the dirty laundry he needs to expose the domestic diva for who he thinks she really is.....a fraud.I was honestly almost turned off by the beginning of the book.  Josh came down so hard on Tess Banyon's image and success, it showed a really ugly side of him right from the start.  Jealousy, petty remarks, and bitterness are not becoming, especially in the context of this novel.  I know it was the set up for the rest of the novel but it really showed what I thought was a weak side to Josh's character.Once the novel got rolling and Josh is introduced to Tess the story improved and I started to enjoy it more.  A lot of humor was tossed into the mix and there was definitely some well written chemistry between Tess and Josh.  As the story evolved, the agenda that Josh has at first slowly changes and we get a glimpse of his change of heart, even as he discovers things about Tess that he correctly assumed.  But his assumptions aren't cut-and-dried; they are complicated and deserved a much better explanation than a trashing that he first wanted to publish.Then, when Tess realizes that Josh and the trash-talking JR are one and the same, the feelings she has developed for Josh disintegrate, causing her to remove him from her life.  His true motives are revealed also, as, what was supposed to be a first draft article is published without his consent or editing.  This novel does have the Happily Ever After we come to expect from an Entangled author, however I'm not really sure that Josh deserved it.Review Copy Courtesy of the Publisher at no cost, in exchange for an honest review.",3.0
"I h*a*t*e it when you read things like ""she only thought she was of value because he wanted her..."" or ""not all curvy women are so self-hating...""  To those review-ers, I would say ""shut up"", but freedom of speech and all that.  So instead I'll say to you, ""don't listen"".At our most core element we have a desire to be wanted/needed/accepted/liked.  If we didn't then we would all live in separate caves now wouldn't we?  Everyone in someway or another is insecure about something (real or perceived) about themselves that is unlovable/unacceptable/unwantable. That is, if you're human.  And because we live in a visual society, it's usually our external appearance. And if you don't believe that, go back to Neverland, because that's apparently where you reside.What this author does through the insecurity or self-image issues with her heroine is allow her to see that she is accepted in a world that puts it's acceptance on the outside.  What she does with the hero, who is generally drool-worthy is allow them to be healed .... not in the receiving of love, but in the giving of it.  She shows that those that are accepted by the society that values the external only, are broken too.  Just in a different way.  Inside.  And the inside wounds can only be healed by someone whose inside is never sought out because they get past the external test.Enough psycho-babble.Buy the damn book!

I tried to guess the locations as the group traveled across the country, making allies and trade partners.Obviously I'm not a writer and reviews don't flow from my fingertips.  I'm just an ordinary reader, sharing my opinion and want to share a great story with those that share my interest.If you love zombies too, this book (series) is for you :)",5.0

I loved that it always kept me on edge. This is a wonderful book. I have also read the edge of never and both books are really fascinating. It's real down to earth story.

Food is good and reasonably  priced. We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner.

"I love the entire 'Burg series.  The relationship between Rocky and Layne in this book is intense from the beginning, and Layne's dedication to helping find out what caused Rocky to run from him years ago is captivating.

Definitely one of KA's must reads!",5.0
"Blake's life is a living hell, possessed by a demon who has turned Blake into a killer, Blake knows that he must die so that the demon will never hurt anyone again, but with the demon calling the shots it's not going to be easy.  When loner vampire Elise witnesses Blake's suicide attempt, the hopelessness of his situation stirs her long lost humanity and as Elise gets to know Blake and is touched by his selflessness, Elise discovers that even though she's immortal, by isolating herself to protect her heart from further hurts, she's forgotten how to live.Set in the Night Huntress world, with a short appearance by Cat and Bones and a longer one by Mencheres, Devil to Pay works much better on its own than it did sandwiched in between regency romances in it's original release inFour Dukes and a Devil. Storywise, Devil to Pay manages to get the job done even in the shorter space, the leads are both likable and sympathy stirring, and there's nothing like impending death to spur a relationship along. I liked the ending but wouldn't have minded getting to bask in the afterglow of the happily ever after just a bit - but then that's the nature of shorts.On the whole, Devil to Pay ends up being a nice little tidbit for Frost fans who missed it in its first incarnation, but Frost brings in just enough of her world so that the story will still work for fans-to-be.",4.0

"This author has created a world where it is imperative that Vampires and Humans coexist.  The survival of the world as we know it depends on it.  Following the prophecy will insure it.Soren is a 100% sexy vampire. . . unfortunately . . . he is 98% arrogant ass as well.  Natalie is one tough woman who owns her own drywall company, proud of her accomplishments.  She is on her own, since her mom is locked up in the crazy bin.  Then she witnesses Soren doing what he does best . . and sure it looks to Natalie like he just killed someone.  On top of that, Soren can't erase her memory of what she saw or of him.So let's recap. . . Soren, arrogant although sexy killer.  Natalie, strong willed, proud, has a crazy mom, witnesses a murder.Soren can't erase Natalie's memory, that should not have been a problem.  Now he is stuck with her until he can figure out what to do.The sexual tension between Soren and Natalie picks up as Soren tries to figure out what the hell is going on.  Each time Natalie tries to get away from Soren . . . well the humor is not lost on this reader.  Buy this book and see what happens.  I have loved both the preceding books in this series and this one by far outshines the rest.  The prophecy is going to pull you in and when you get to the other side of this awesome Vampire/Human/Demon series you will be wanting more.

Honor is an amazing man, and I loved him.This story was like a slow, passionate hymn to love, longing, and...well, honor.Every word is well placed, every emotion well timed. This is one of those rare books where I find myself looking at the pages, frantic as they dwindle in my hands. I don't want it to be over, but I want to know where we are going.Ah, and the destination is never in doubt. The journey though, it was worth the ride.Amazing.

The worst place to get food delivered from. I would suggest starving over ordering here!! So they charge you for the food you order followed by never showing up for it (in the next 1:45 hrs) and then never bothering to answer the damn telephone which I guess they still have to get used to. I mean it must have been really hard to pick it up and answer it in a RESTAURANT!!! Let's see if they bother giving the food they have actually charged me for if I show up.,1.0

"This book became quite the delightful addiction for me, causing me to neglect almost everything else! I loved how the author fleshed out every character. I came to feel I knew them all quite well, and they all had their own unique personalities. The story is one of the wittiest I've ever read, and flows quickly from one event to the next. There is no tedium here. The dialogue, especially, is crisp and natural and often made me laugh out loud. Beneath the fun and laughter, though, there is a darker element: a mysterious premonition that bodes ill for our heroes & heroines. I was moved, for instance, by Sophie's distress as her beloved husband falls further and further away from being human into being a monster, and begins to want her in ways that terrify and disgust her. Yet her love never fails, no matter how cruel he becomes.Even Kenrick, the bad guy, becomes more sympathetic through his unquenchable need to be reunited with the one he loves. One can understand such obsessions if one has ever loved and lost.I would personally label ""That Scoundrel &Eacute;mile Dubois"" as SATIRE, not a mere vampire or time travel story. It's far too witty, cunning, and subtle to be an ordinary ""adventure story.""One thing I will complain about: if a man did that much ""Chin Chucking"" to me I would divorce him. I quite felt for Sophie in this regard, and was envious of her patience.I would recommend this book for anyone who likes vampire stories, the kind which seems, somehow, to combine the sexy vampire (&agrave; la Twilight) with the evil vampire (&agrave; la Dracula). And time traveling. And high adventure, and rascally scoundrels, and Victorian literature, and Welsh scenery. I do look forward to More Work by This Talented Author!",5.0

He is a very private person and his closest friends don't even know the inner turmoil he deals with on a daily basis.. Then comes one call! One call that changes it all.Lane didn't expect that one call to change his world on its axis and bring so much joy to his life. It also brings up a lot of answers he has been searching for and realizes everything was not how he thought it was.

"I must say that they have taken it up a notch or two, both with their menu selections and the quality of the food!

I started with a very delicious dirty martini, is there anything else? The escargot, burgundy style were cooked to perfection with shallots, garlic, butter, herbs and finished off with a good red wine, so yummy and I lapped up every drop of the sauce with the grilled crustini!

The mushroom bisque was to die for, I haven't had such a wonderful mushroom bisque since dining at the Terrace Restaurant at Longwood Gardens! In fact, I will go so far as to say this was quite memorable and probably the best I will ever have. How they were able to chop those mushrooms into the size of a speck, I will never know. The bisque was so very flavorful and topped with crème fraiche, truffles and white truffle oil. Remarkable indeed!

Listen to this! 14 ounces of broiled rare Australian lamb chops, that melted in my mouth with each bite. They were served as two triple cut chops and I was humming while I was gathering each tender morsel of these flavorful chops. The chops were huge, so meaty and not one bit of fat, so much better than the fingernail sized Colorado lamb chops, so much better that I did not even offer hubby a bite.

Speaking of hubby, he did share in some of my escargot and mushroom bisque, surprisingly, as he will normally eat neither and really did enjoy both.

Michael then had the wedge and I really appreciated how they served it, all was on one long rectangular plate, with the wedge in the center, red onions in one corner, diced ripe tomatoes in another, sliced boiled eggs, and a side of bleu cheese dressing, heavily loaded with bleu cheese crumbles. 

He also had an 18 ounce porterhouse, which he ordered rare and devoured it, saying that it was not the best he has ever had, but he enjoyed it.

With our entrees you have a choice of baked potato, truffled mashed, stuffed baked potato, sea salted shoestring potatoes or sticky rice. I chose the frites and hubby had the loaded baked potato, both were very good. They also have plenty of premium sides that you can order.

The atmosphere is relaxing, beautiful decor, the servers all work together and this time I left quite impressed. The prices were surprising low compared to other upscale steak houses. Once again, we had Joseph as our server, he's not as shy as he was in the beginning.",4.0

To be honest I scanned through the book.  It attempts to poke fun at the 'how to publish' books sold via the kindle ecosystem.  Unlike other readers I did not find it amusing perhaps because i was looking for something serious and with more substance.  I agree it is an attempt at shameless  promotion and profit.  For me there is no value in this book.  I can simply conclude that perhaps I am not the writer's target customer.  I did not pay for it so guess I got the proportionate value...ZERO.

So I had a go with Emma Child's book to find out more about these eight-legged monsters and see how justified my fears are.I did learn a lot about spiders, including these tidbits:* Spiders are found on every continent except Antarctica, in all types of environments from deserts to tropical rain forests.* Spiders have very poor vision, so they rely more on their other senses - feel, taste, and smell.* Spiders spin their webs with silk, but not all spiders spin webs.* All spiders release venom when they bite, but most bites aren't dangerous to humans.* Some spiders live together in big groups called colonies.* Some female spiders, like the black widow, kill their mate after their eggs are fertilized.After discussing the general characteristics of spiders, the book describes several of the better known species of spiders, then concludes with &#34;Spider Fun Facts.&#34; (Did you know that the average house has 30 spiders?)It's a good introduction to spiders for both kids and grownups. And it's not too scary, even for me.",5.0
"4.5 starsSergei Stolkov is a young captain in the Coalition Forces; he believes completely in the Doctrine but isn't too thrilled with his current assignment as aide to a general on the planet of Cirokko. He is unsure it's in the best interest of the coalition to try to conquer Cirokko, and fears it will once again earn its nickname, Fool's Gamit.  Added to his frustration with the mission objective, his mixed feelings about the brother General he serves causes his life to be mostly a waking nightmare. But Sergei is a good soldier, trained to serve and not question, he will unswervingly do as ordered.Mike is a CovOp operative, embedded with the rebel's of Cirokko, he and his partner Pat are masters at what they do. Pat's mission is to embed himself with rebels in the mountains, Mike's to blend into the local culture of the provincial capital of Dedis and embed himself with the Coalition Forces by seducing one of its officers. He speaks both the local language as well as Doctrine standard fluently. While adept at any kind of weapon his best weapon is his own body and mind, both of which he intends to use to his advantage.Mike not only seduces himself into Sergei's bed but into his heart as well.  Unfortunately for Mike, what starts out as an op soon turns personal, and he finds himself not pretending to fall for Sergei but actually landing head first in love with him. Now the games begin, Mike has to try to do his job while trying to protect Sergei. Sergei must try to reconcile what he and the doctrine consider unnatural feelings for Mike against his duty. Both will have their minds, bodies and souls put to extreme tests and both will discover just how deep their love goes.As a team Aliksandr Voinov and Rhianon Etzweiler have created a world of intrigue, betrayal and seduction with such skill that from the first sentence the reader knows they are going to be in for a ride. While the story takes place in another time and place and is full of alien names and references, it is so well told that it's easy to feel exactly what Mike and Sergei experience.We meet Mike and Pat first as they watch a coalition convey traversing the long way around the Zasidka Pass, a pass that has been the ruin of many a mission and will play a big part in the story (that's the only spoiler I'll give about that). Immediately we learn Mike is a rugged man, well suited to his job and with a slightly off center sense of humor. Pat is a bit of a curmudgeon, it's clear why he stays in the background and Mike does the front work. As with all partners, they get on each others nerves but have each others backs as well. As the story progresses we learn a lot about Mike but Pat remains a bit of a mystery.Our first meeting with Sergei shows us he is a team player but not a happy camper. We soon learn what it is about the brother General that causes him to be conflicted and trust me, it isn't pretty.  Sergei is a well trained soldier, the coalition forces are referred to as zombies, and Sergei has the act down pat. He is able to control his emotions and it's impossible to tell his thoughts by looking at this face.The first meeting of Mike and Sergei pretty much sets the tone for their relationship throughout the book. Mike is the more mature of the two and certainly the more experienced. While the book is chock full of military action and intrigue, for me the conflict both men faced was the meat of the book. There were scenes that were painful to read, the authors pulled no punches and didn't pretty it up. I enjoyed this book immensely, I can't think of a thing to complain about in it, which is rare indeed for me. Why not 5 stars? It was a good book and I enjoyed it, but I didn't feel myself needing to read it to the end in one sitting. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to readers of science fiction, readers of romance, and readers of just a darn good story.My usual cautions apply - there is unspeakable graphic violence, there is M/M sex- some very graphic, there are not nice things happening but none of it should make the mature reader uncomfortable.Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Review Team",4.0

"When Madison's sister dies and she inherits the Naughty Bits lingerie shop she sees it as the perfect opportunity to get away from her boring job and start a new life for herself. She didn't realise how hard it would be to turn her hand to selling sex toys though and it looks like she's going to need some help learning how to make her customers comfortable. She has been burying her submissive side for so long that she has no idea who she really is any more and the incredibly sexy Dom from the shop next door seems to be more than willing to help her loosen up a little. Can she be brave enough to take a risk with Logan or will her new career end in disaster?I have a confession - I've never read anything by Joey W. Hill before. I've heard so many good things about her books though so when I got the opportunity to review this one I jumped at the chance to read it. I have to admit that while I liked the story it didn't wow me as much as I hoped it would. I have now come to the conclusion that serial novels are just not for me. I want to be able to read the whole story in one sitting and I do honestly think that if this story had been released as a full length novel I would have happily carried on to the end and probably really enjoyed it. The problem is that this part didn't grab me enough to make me spend the money it will cost to buy the remaining three instalments. Another issue with serials is that they nearly always work out more expensive than buying a full length book and that makes me very reluctant to part with my money. Add in the fact that this book is releasing in monthly instalments so the final part won't be available until July and I can pretty much guarantee these characters will be completely off my radar by then (when you consider that I'll probably read at least 80 books between now and then it's no surprise that something has to be INCREDIBLY special to hold my attention for that length of time).Madison is an interesting character but I found it very hard to relate to her, she is so sexually repressed and embarrassed about her desires and I don't like the way she pushes everyone away. We do see her start to explore her fantasies a little by the end of the novella though and I have a feeling she's going to go on a real emotional journey as well as a sexual awakening throughout the series which should be interesting to see. I'm hoping she'll become a lot more likeable by the end of the series because I really did want shake her and tell her to get a grip at times. I enjoyed the humour of seeing Madison thrown in the deep end with her sister's lingerie shop though, she is so incredibly naive and now she's supposed to be advising customers and selling sex toys which was very amusing.At the moment I think Logan is the main draw for me to want to continue the series, he runs the hardware shop next door to Naughty Bits but he also builds custom made BDSM equipment and trains submissives on the side. Logan was also good friends with Madison's sister Alice and she asked him to keep an eye on her after she was gone. Alice knew Madison inside out even though they've been estranged so I think she was aware of how much Madison needs to be pushed if she's ever going to learn to let herself go and loosen up and I'm pretty sure Logan is the perfect man for the job. My main complaint was that we didn't get enough of him in this instalment but hopefully that will be remedied as the series continues.Unfortunately this novella cuts off the story just as things are starting to get interesting, I would like to know what happens next but I doubt I'll continue with the series unless it is released as a bind up for a reasonable price. I'm not going to be forced into paying more than normal for a novel just because it has been split into four chunks. Die hard Joey W. Hill fans or people who like this new trend of serial novels will probably be happy to start the series now but otherwise my suggestion is to wait until July & then give it a try when at least you're not going to have to wait on a cliffhanger between each new instalment.",3.0
"Hailey is a preschool teacher who has been taking care of her younger sister for most of their lives. When her sister returns home pregnant after touring with the band Half-Life Hailey decides it is her responsibility to figure out the father is and make him take responsibility. She borrows some of her sisters &#34;wild&#34; clothing and goes to the hotel to try and get some answers. She runs into Lock, the lead singer of Half-Life who agrees to let her hang around and ask questions in exchange for three days of being at his beck and call. One contract alter and Hailey finds herself experiencing an intense sexual connection unlike any she has knows. While she struggles to get information about her sister, she also struggles with forming an attachment to a man she knows she will never see again when the contract expires when the three days are up. Lock finds himself experiencing all kinds of emotions he never expected when he and Hailey start their sexual relationship. He has messed up a lot in his life and with his band, but one year sober he is going to start to try and make some better decisions from her on in.While the theme of a sexual situation relationship turning emotional isn't a new concept, and neither is the elusive rock star falling for a &#34;real&#34; woman, this book managed to keep things interesting and fresh. I liked that the story wasn't about the rough and raw rock star turning everything around for a woman, but rather two people feeling a strong connection and finding that they could give each other a sexual connection that they both needed. The chemistry between Hailey and Lock was definitely hot, and the sexy scenes were very sexy. The story line with Hailey's sister Chloe was interesting as well, and I liked seeing that play out. I enjoyed that these characters weren't black and white and that they were each complex in they own way, as people in real life are. One thing I would have liked is a little more of everything. A little more development of each character and their story. That said, this book held my interest throughout and I will gladly read more in this series. 3.5 stars.",3.0

What a great subject to read about!This book is very well written and draws you in immediately with fascinating facts about animals that could conceivably live forever (if they didn't get eaten, sick etc). Not only does the author mention animals that are immortal, but she goes into the 'whys' of the matter too, albeit briefly, which is perfect for reading this book to children.I read this book on the kindle paperwhite and whilst the photos were in black and white, they were clear and easy to see.I would definitely recommend this book to any parent with children interested in animals.",5.0

"The Blades of the Old Empire is the first book in the new Majat Code Series.  It is an epic fantasy that follows Kythan Dorn, a young prince with rare elemental magic, and his companions.  Kyth&#8217;s life changes forever when mysterious men from a cult was outlawed centuries ago attack him and his friends, and it turns out these men have strange powers of their own.  When the Kaddim cult realizes that their power works neither on Kyth or his Majat Warrior bodyguard Kara, Kyth and Kara end up at the top of the Kaddim&#8217;s hit list.  Kyth, his stepbrother Alder, and Kara go on a mission to find support from the grasslands, trying to avoid the schemes of the Kaddim along the way.  At the same time Kyth&#8217;s friend Ellah goes with his father and the Keepers, hoping to learn some of the Keeper healing secrets, and how to enhance her own ability to tell whether or not someone speaks the truth.  Unless Kyth and his father can get support from other leaders in the land, the church, which has been infiltrated by the Kaddim cult, will execute Kyth because of his powers and depose his father from the throne.I realize that this description of the plot sounds a bit convoluted, but the author plops the reader right down in the middle of the story, and it takes a while to discern what exactly is happening in the story.  This makes it hard to do a short description because I had very little backstory to explain before having to relate the setup of the plot. This is not necessarily a bad thing.  There are many amazing books like The Black Company or the Malazan books that put reader down in the middle of the action with little to no explaination.  Blades of the Empire is an enjoyable book, and once you get familiar with the characters and the setting, it is easy to route for the protagonists and against the antagonists.  The book is also a fast paced read, and it contains plenty of action.  The Majat Warriors in particular are very fascinating characters, and I would love to learn more about them in further books.  There are also many hints of an older, not quite extinct society, which could be expanded upon a lot more as the series goes on.  There is also an element of romance to this book, and I liked that it was tasteful and did not completely overwhelm the story line.  This book is action packed from the very first page, and is a good start to a series that I will look forward to reading more of.I would have enjoyed this book a bit more if there had been more world building.  The story went so fast that I did not feel immersed in the world, and I would have liked to be a little more familiar with each character.  The plotline was explained sufficiently, and after a while the plot was easy to follow, but it was not explained with the level of detail that I am partial to, or that I think most readers require to bring them into the story.Overall, this was an entertaining, but not completely engaging story.  The series does have a lot of potential, and I plan on reading the next book in the Majat Code series to see if there is more world building.  I would rate this book a 7/10.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley and the publisher in return for an honest review.",4.0

"I knew before I even started this book that I was going to love it. It's written by Cardeno C., whom I am a giant fan of, it's the fourth book in the 'Home' series and I have loved the three previous books, and the premise of love at first sight is something I believe in and which happened to me when I met my husband. So, before I even opened the book, I had a trifecta of goodness happening.It took me about two paragraphs to fall completely in love with Jonathan. He's shy, sweet, gentle, naive, clumsy, easily distracted, loving, lonely, hates to disappoint anyone, and he doesn't do confrontation. These characteristics made for an amazing man, but they also helped to create the mess that Jonathan found himself in at the age of eighteen. He let his best friend accost him on the night of their graduation and take his virginity because she was angry at her boyfriend. During his graduation/class trip to New York, Jonathan saw a man and fell in love at first sight, leading Jonathan to move to the city in hopes of finding him. Because of his oopsie with his best friend, he finds out he's going to be a father, and in his loneliness and despair Jonathan ends up involved in internet gay porn. That's a lot to have happen at the age of eighteen. Luckily for Jonathan the police raid one of the porn sets and he meets Officer Jake Owens. (Ring a bell, fans? 'Where He Ends and I Begin')Jonathan gets his life together in time for his son, Samuel's, appearance. Jonathan is a wonderful dad and after three years in New York he decides it's time to give up his foolish hope of finding his soul mate, the man with the blue eyes he saw that one time, and he returns home with Samuel to build a life where his son has family. On his birthday his parents send him out the door and he finds himself in a bar, a place he hasn't been in years, and just Jonathan's luck some jerk recognizes him from his porn days and tries to make Jonathan come home with him. Jonathan is saved by the bar's owner who happens to be.....ta daa.....his soul mate, the man with the blue eyes. Jonathan faints right at his feet. I love him, he's so stinking adorable.David is fascinated by this gorgeous young man who makes him want things he's never desired before. Jonathan makes David think of forever and that this honest guy who embarrasses so easily and blushes at a dime might just be his for life. David is a little older, established in his life, and there are things he doesn't discuss with other people: his family, his childhood and his feelings being primary. So David is a little shocked to realize he wants to open up to Jonathan. When Jonathan leaves early the following morning and tells David he can't spend the weekend with him, it sets off a chain reaction leaving David to do a whole lot of soul searching so he can get Jonathan back in his life. Of course, David has no idea about the worst (the porn) and the best (Sam) things in Jonathan's life as Jonathan doesn't want to scare David away.There wasn't anything that I didn't love about this book. I realize I say that a lot about Cardeno C.'s work, but the author really is that good and I feel as if I'm right there immersed within the story. Watching David and Jonathan fall in love was intense and amazing. Seeing what happened after Jonathan told David that he'd fallen in love with him when he saw him in New York, and then revealing about his past porn life, just reinforced my belief that there are good, decent people in the world who know how to love through thick and thin. Thank you, Cardeno, for the much needed reminder and another beautiful story!NOTE: This book was provided by Dreamspinner Press for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews",5.0

"Of all the screen protectors I've tried for my Kindle Fire, theMoshi iVisor AG Screen Protection for Kindle Fire (Anti-Glare) - Bubble Free Installation (will not fit HD or HDX models)was the best. It was the easiest to install, was bubble-free, and worked relatively well touch-wise although some of the Fire's sensitivity suffered when it was in place. I can't say that about the other protectors I tried. All of those that were a film without an edge were a PITB to install and never worked well.When I got my Kindle Paperwhite, I wanted to get a Moshi product again, but I was worried that just a thin film sheet (like this one is) would be as difficult and problematic to install as some of the screen protective products I'd tried before I went with the Moshi iVisor.I followed the installation instructions and did not have any difficulty installing this AirFoil screen protector. It was easy to get it started going on straight, and after that it was a piece of cake. The cleaning step is crucial for a good experience. I did wind up with a small speck of dust underneath the top edge of the AirFoil that I could not manage to get out, but it's not at all visible when the Paperwhite is on. I don't think it's likely to pull away from the Kindle screen. The instructions say you can slide the protector without having to remove it if you get it installed a bit off-kilter, but mine went on absolutely straight on the first try.The best part of this Moshi AirFoil is the sensitivity. I think it's even better with the AirFoil in place than it was without any protector on my Paperwhite. It's almost like not having anything at all on the screen. And, because I have a puppy who is always bouncing up into my lap, I feel safer with some protection on the screen.",5.0

"As I read this book I could not help but think about how most teachers teach. The connection I make is that most teachers, either consciously or subconsciously, teach the way they were taught when they were students. They emulate their experience.In comparison with parenting, my best guess is that many parents discipline their children the same way they were disciplined. Where teachers make positive changes in their practice is by reading, reflection, and observation of what works best. Parents can do the same thing, and this book is a very useful resource to do this.I feel this book makes a contribution to improving parenting skills. This happens in the same way as it does for teachers; through reading, reflection and observation. Therefore this book is a valuable asset in the hands of a conscientious parent who is actively seeking ways to provide positive discipline for their child. I have no doubt that within the pages of this book there is helpful information for both new and experienced parents. This is a must-read for parents who are looking for ways to make disciplining their child a positive and beneficial experience for their child(ren).Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofHow to Teach Debating: Theory & Practical Handbook for the Non-Native Teacher,Debate Coach & International English Language Learner Worldwide",5.0

"This is another great story by Daniel Kelly, who truly has mastered the art of writing.  In this story, the reader meets Jack, who begins to understand the differences and meaning of reality as he knows it and the unspoken paranormal world. It is Jack&#8217;s tale of true love (his first), as well as that of his older neighbor. Together, the two tales bring us a better understanding and appreciation of both characters&#8217; worlds. The story is set in Marblehead, MA, a well-known town close to and somewhat influenced by its more well-known neighbor, the town of Salem. Taking place in the autumn timeframe only brings home the Salem paranormal influence and underlying theme, for that town becomes a place for spooks of all types as Halloween approaches. As with his other stories, the author has definitely developed and pulled off another great story for readers of all ages and interests. Though a short story, the characters and the setting are very well developed and only leave the reader wanting for more. I can easily see this story growing into a longer novel, with some fleshing out by the author. I received this from Library Thing to read and review.",5.0
"Pride and Surrender is a novella that packs all the sensual heat and emotion of a much longer work. Juliet is a strong-minded, intelligent heroine with a weakness that makes her easy to empathize with. She struggles with a tragic fear of her own emotions and a distrust that a man strong and alpha enough to excite her will really want her over other women who display more stereotypical warm, outgoing feminine personality traits. She has been used to hiding this aspect of herself and focusing on her professional life. She keeps her softer, more sensual side hidden. She goes through the motions, dating men who are safe but do not excite her. It is easy to root for her, to hope that she will find the emotional courage to overcome her fears and make the leap to trust the hero. It would have been interesting to go into why Juliet is this way but we are told that she just has always been this way and does not really know why.Christos is handsome and alpha and sexy. He also possesses the understanding to see the real Julia behind the ""ice-queen"" mask she shows the world. He is assertive in his approach, patiently weakening Julia's resistance. In the past, he fought his attraction to her, but he's worked through all that and now is determined to win this woman who is more than his match. I liked this aspect of the hero being ready and open for love. Devlin does a good job of giving him a backstory that makes it believable that he has all of these emotional resources in the story. He knows how to be strong and yet tender too. Yet he's all alpha.There's a rich sensual, visual evocative aspect to this erotic romance that sets it apart. Devlin is often economical with scenery descriptions, preferring to keep the focus tight on the internal emotional aspect of the characters and the interpersonal conflict between the hero and heroine. But when she does focus on external images, they are always powerful ones that are directly vital to the story. I loved the descriptions of the heroine's bedroom and her photography. I really believe this story would not have been as powerful written in any other POV but first and I think it was the best decision to write it that way.There were no external antagonists in this story, except for the phantoms of doubt and distrust in the heroine's mind. The conflict was limited to the Hero and Heroine and their internal struggles. I believe this made the story more powerful, more emotionally intense with the focus strongly on the heroine coming to terms with her lack of comfort with her own emotional nature and her innate doubts about men whom she truly finds desirable.The pace of the romance was just fast enough to give it an edge. The couple had known each other for two years so they already have an emotionally rich history and deep, ongoing sexual tension. The heroine resisted the hero just enough without it becoming tedious or repetitive. And I really enjoyed the feeling underlying emotional danger and passionate warring between them as he rather forcefully courts her. And courts her he does. He is very sensitive to her needs, very nurturing of her emotions and her physical well being while never losing his alpha edge. This is not an easy thing to accomplish but Devlin does so beautifully here.It is a very sensual, spicy story. Devlin really makes the most of the sexual scenes, keeping the threads of emotion and the moment-to-moment sensual experience of the characters at the forefront. Aspects of bondage and submission are brought in a way that emphasizes the trust and sharing. Very refreshing in a contemporary erotica. There's no sense of humiliation or masochism or outrageous kink here. Just pure trust given as a gift in a way that is all the more sexy because it's pure focus.Yes, there could have been a little more view into what made Juliet so distrusting of men and uncomfortable with emotion but when a story sweeps you into such a evocative emotional landscape and allows you such immediate, intimate connection to the character and her experience, one cannot nitpick for long. One can only experience and enjoy. If you love strong, alpha heroes with a tender side and empathize with strong-minded heroines, do yourself a favor and indulge in the chocolate liquor-like richness of this not-to-be-missed erotic romance.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews",5.0

Usually I prefer stories that are more fantastical, where big, important things happen that wouldn't likely ever happen in real life, but this simple story of friendship and growing up is deceptively deep, and I found myself completely engrossed and could not put it down.  Well done, 5 stars!**I was provided a copy of this ebook free from the author for honest review**",5.0
"How I wish that many youth in our society today would ready novels like this.  The coming of true love in its most real sense is something that is often overlooked.  Too often we enter into a love relationship even a marriage thinking that if it does not work, we can always end it legally and go on to something else.  Waiting is not something that we do well.  This author presents the reader with an example of young people today who practice that patience.  They wait for the one that is right for them, and ONLY that one despite other offers and hardships.  There is a real parallel to the Biblical story of Rachel.  Read it and see what patience can bring.",3.0

"Who doesn't love a good ghost story, especially during the Halloween season when the nights are getting longer and there is just a touch of mischief and mystery in the air? I have always loved reading about ghosts. I am fascinated with them and I hardly ever pass up a good story that involves the supernatural, and okay, the cover didn't hurt either.This wasn't so much of a ghost story as it was a love story, for both the ghost and the main characters.And while I couldn't' help being a little disappointed this wasn't more ghostly than it was, the sweet love stories of both Katie and Arabella made up for it.The author did a nice job with this and it really was a fun quick read that any lover of romance and the paranormal will enjoy.",3.0

"This review is so long overdue. What an awesome little restaurant. Was a little nervous to eat here initially as the restaurant was a bit empty but the hostess was so inviting we had to stay. We started with the Blt guac recommended by the hostess and was so glad we did. The addition of bacon and the fried pita crisps, I believe, just set the guac off right. We also added the wings as an appetizer which I'd give a 4 out of 5. The rest of our meal while yummy was/is a bit of a blur because we got so tipsy off the Carnitas margarita which is fresh made with all top shelf liquor. It's quite pricey but would def recommend in a pitcher shared amongst 3-4 ppl. Just beware because that drink will creep up on you. I would highly recommend if you're in the area but dont be fooled by the small store front because there's alot of good things going on inside including pretty funky cool decor.",5.0
"I will be traveling to Abu Dhabi for business at the end of this fall so I have been reading numerous guides in order to prepare. This one is the best! It is packed with information that ranges from the best ways to get around, the customs on tipping, social norms and how you should behave even as a tourist and much, much, more. Not knowing what to expect this book has put my mind at ease as it is clear the author is very knowledgeable on the topic, and provides small details that go overlooked in other books. For example the guide tells that crossing your legs is a sign or rudeness, I would never have known! What great tips! I also found the section on working days and hours very interesting, as well as the part about long handshakes, moving seats as according to status and the fact that business moves very slowly.  Not only was this book very helpful, it was very easy and entertaining to read, I highly recommend it!",5.0
"This was a free download and looked like a cute story.  It wasn't bad.  Shane and Nick have been friends for years.  Nick wanted Shane five years ago but before he could make his move Mark swooped in on Shane and used his money and experience to sweep him off his feet.  Shane was young and dazzled, but unfulfilled.  He and Mark were to marry but Mark didn't turn up and Shane went on his honeymoon with Nick and then realized what he had been missing in bed and out of it with a lover.  Mark has secrets that we don't find out about. The end made me go ""What the...?""  But do not despair - there is a sequel, which I haven't read yet and that is a novel.This could be a little short story stand alone or you can go on to buy Shane and Nick's story in In or Out?

"I've been a fan of Mr. Lincoln's novellas and poetry for some time, but this selection of poetry organized in one sensual collection is a beautiful demonstration of the writer's gift for encapsulating passion in a single line of verse. Fans of the erotica author's previous work may be surprised to find an anthology that features two very different sections of prose, one focused primarily on many of the physical, primal natures of love and sex within the content category &#34;Body&#34; and poems reflecting more contemplative and introspective views on life and love under the umbrella heading &#34;Soul.&#34;MINE: BODY & SOUL: COLLECTED POEMS is a thoughtful and varied assortment of Lincoln's talents on display. He can describe an encounter between two lovers and leave you dripping with anticipation at his next words. Just the same, he can take your mind to a faraway place of longing and wistfulness that leaves your heart aching.  This is a beautiful read and well worth readers' time.  ~ C. Kuhn",5.0

"I enjoyed this story quite a bit.  It's a breezy read, despite some of the more serious story elements that come into play.  I was expecting to have more difficulty with the Welsh-isms, being an American, but I didn't have any problem following the story of Nicholas.  This is sort of a reverse coming of age story; a story about finding yourself by finding what you forgot about yourself along the way growing up.

"This isn't just a light-weight serial romance about a woman forced to travel around the world with her ex-fiance in order to collect half of her mother's $50 million fortune (with the other half going to the ex who hadn't seen either of them for five years -- Gee THANKS, mom!), but it is apparently a SAGA.Initially I was fooled by the scuba diving and leisurely breakfasts into thinking this was just another wish-fulfillment travel romance, but then I would look at the cover and remind myself that I was reading a saga.Will Ashly forgive Jake for not wanting to get married at age twenty?  Will they collect the millions and make their awesome lives even awesomer?  Will there be continued jet set adventures written with details plucked from travel guides?

"I was excited to read the latest book in this series, as it was such an exciting and good idea that the author had used. The western era clan have been left behind and now the story focuses on the present day Maclarens. Heath, who now heads the Maclaren&#8217;s various businesses, lacks love in his life, and the novel focuses on his deep friendship with Anne, and the decisions they must make to discover what they mean to each other.

"I really can't say enough great things about this inn! I am not typically a B&B type of person - I like my privacy and I am not really a ruffled-pillow kind of girl. But this beautifully-decorated inn really strikes the perfect note between personal attention and leaving you be. Tim, the innkeeper, is exceptional and polite as well as a great source of local knowledge and recommendations. Breakfasts in the dining room were absolutely delightful. The food was excellent and the sunlight streaming through the windows was really a perfect start to the day - which could be as busy or as relaxing as you want, since nearby New Hope and Lambertville offer a lot of options for shopping, dining, and walking around, and there are some great museums in the area as well.

The grounds are beautiful in a natural, not-overstyled sort of way, and the pool area was just wonderful. We really enjoyed just strolling around, looking at things and talking; and we spent a great few hours lounging out by the pool, reading and swimming and napping. The house and the grounds both managed to be luxurious and indulgent without feeling excessive - it was perfect for a calming, romantic getaway. Highly recommended - we will definitely be going back!",5.0
"I was given this book as an ARC for an honest review.I gave this beautiful book 5 starting over stars.This is my first book that I have read from this Author.Well of course, it's her Debut book:)This is a love story about Parker and Sadie.Sadie is a beautiful woman who was in a relationship gone bad, her ex-husband who she met in college and was absolutely wonderful to her, turns abusive physically and mentally as soon as they are married. Sadie is a very strong woman who has endured a life time of pain, in such a little bit of time. She gets out of this relationship with her now ex-husband Brent and tries to start a new.She just moved in to a wonderful house, and has a great job teaching music just like she always wanted. On her way home to her place she gets pulled over for speeding by a gorgeous officer who lets her go with a warning, and this is where Parker comes in.Parker is such a beautiful soul, he sees Sadie for what she is right away. Beautiful and worth loving, he gives her the space that she needs even when he doesn't know what she has gone through. He treats her the way she should have always been treated. With respect and admiration, he not only thinks she is beautiful on the outside, but so much more on the inside. Don't I wish that all men were this way. YES I do!! He is gorgeous, a cop, and just damn near perfect!!! Please make me one of these Elaine!!!So can Sadie let go of her past and let someone in even when they seem genuine? She trusted Brent and look where that got her? She has a big secret too and that secret just might break her and Parker. Can she let her walls down?I loved this story, it tore at my heart, but also gave me hope that there are second chances for people out there that go through what she did. This is a story of hope and Sadie finally finds her man, the one that she should have had all along. He is perfect, he treats her with respect and love, and is patient  and kind. This is a beautiful story that will have you laughing, and crying with Sadie. These two were such a breath of fresh air. I loved how he just came in and swept her off her feet and how she refused to play the victim. Yes she still has her problems I mean who wouldn't with all she has been through, but she doesn't let that stop her from growing and trying to get through them. And she doesn't whine about them. She gets up dusts herself off and tries to make the best of what life is giving her. I am not so sure that I would be able to do that. This story was beautifully written, Thank you Elaine for sharing your story with us. I look forward to reading more from you in the future. You can believe that I am a fan now for life:) &#60;3",5.0

"As the parent of two teenagers, I am always looking for great books to read with my kids so that we can have a family book club.  Another boy in his class recommended this book to my son, and we sampled it on our Kindle before buying.  After reading just the first few pages, all three of us wanted to keep reading - we were hooked by the interesting story, well written characters and exciting plot line.  Both my son and I like books set in dystopian societies but this is one of the most interesting societal setups that we have ever read (better even than ""The Hunger Games"" which had our favorite societal setting before reading ""The Fall"").There are a few heart-breaking twists in the middle of the story that really propel the story forward and draw you deeper into the story.  I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it yet, but one of the main characters, Skye, seems to be bi-polar... I hope that this is addressed moving forward because I think that is an important issue for teen readers to see addressed.""The Fall"" was a smash hit with all of us, and we are looking forward to the rest of the series.  There are some mysteries that I hope are resolved in the next books in the series, so if the author is reading this: please don't leave us hanging!  I like finding books that are appealing to both teenagers and adults that I can read with my family and I am glad that this one found us!",5.0

"The casino is under major construction, so getting in and out are kind of hectic, but it's a nice facility. I have two major issues here though: 1.) The Hard Rock brand in and of itself is an experience for customers, whether or not it's the casino a restaurant or a museum. Therefore, people who work there should be expert enough on the brand and tourist attractions to guide customers and answer basic questions about the primary thing that makes Hard Rock a brand: the legendary items and artifacts that are the basis of the business. No one who worked there could direct us to any of the artifacts we were looking for. Not even the two people at the information desk. That's really a disadvantage to the organization and lessens the enjoyment for the customer if they have to walk all around the casino to look for a picture of Prince or Patti LaBelle's dress. They need to have some sort of manual or chart that documents where things are and the workers need to be trained on it too. 2.) my second issue is that their food court absolutely sucks. For this to be such a big casino and such a big tourist attraction, they need to expand their food offerings. There are like 3 food court options and then there's the Hard Rock restaurant, which isn't of interest to lots of people being that the food is mediocre at all of them. I've been to several Hard Rock restaurants across the country and the food is consistently mediocre and chainy. Unfortunately the food court offers no rescue either.",2.0

"After spending the night playing with an oujia board in a church graveyard,,  thirtren-year-old Ivy Hart arrives home at 4:00AM to hear her fifteen-year-old sister Mary Ella screaming with labor pains. Rather than calling the nurse, their grandmother instructs Ivy to call their social worker, who says Mary Ella has to go to the hospital to get her ""appendix out"" after giving birth.Diane Chamberlain has created a wonderful, unique voice in Ivy, a poor girl growing up half a century ago. She captures the dialect of a girl from that time, using appropriate slang. My only criticism, and I'm sure others will disagree, is the use of the word ""Negro"" rather than the more commonly used ""N word"" in the south among white people. My personal belief is that sanitizing the word to be more socially appropriate in 2013 does a disservice to history by making racial prejudice a little less terrible. I understand using a milder word not to alienate readers, but I'd prefer the more commonly used word (which I abhor), as ugly as that word is, for historical integrity.",5.0
Wow. It's pretty hard for me to properly articulate my feelings for this book after just finishing it. I will try to do it justice. Arsen is beautifully written. It's captivating. It's heartbreaking. I literally had my heart in my throat at one point. It's like no other book that I've read. It is the type of book that made me feel. It reached in and literally ripped my heart out of my chest. Reading it was an experience. A book like Arsen is the reason why I love to read!,5.0
"Behind the amicable, genuine appearance of Dennis Rask is an insidious force. Tucker has crafted the perfect psycho. With his easy and trustworthy ways, Rask ingratiates himself. He works his way into families, families riddled with their own insecurities and contradictions, and then he begins. Although the actions of Rask are deplorable, he is not merely a one-dimensional character. He is intricate and dynamic, a product of his own strained familial relations, and master of his lethal game. His adeptness at winning over the mom and children is almost admirable, even though his intent could not be more dark. Juxtaposed with the cunning Rask is the equally sharp Detective Bostik. Bostik is appalled and disgusted by the ways of the psychopath, and catching this sicko becomes the engrossing mainstay of the novel--despite a dearth of evidence. Although the novel traces the investigation into the dubious suicides and deaths of the Connors, I found Rask and Bostick to be the most compelling. Be warned: lewdness, perversion and horrid mutilation pervade. However, the violence and sex serve their purpose. They are not mindlessly gratuitous--they are there for a reason. And more likely than not, they'll keep the pages turning. That is, if you can stomach the journey...",5.0

"This is a very well researched book with sufficient medical terminology to enable even a young person to be able to grasp the basics of Vitamin D and the importance of this Vitamin in maintaining health.The writing style of the Author is relaxed, with just enough scientific data and description to keep the reader engaged without being boring! Every aspect of the benefits of Vitamin D is discussed in detail as are the effects of deficiency.There are many facts and figures discussed, relating to the known links to disease and other ailments pertaining to insufficient Vitamin D.The Author deals with age related Vitamin D shortfall and covers in some depth the needs of the over 70's and Pregnant Women. The startling facts of low Vitamin D intake during gestation and the resultant problems with infants are disturbing!Plenty of debate on that elusive element which occasionally breaks through the clouds in the Northern Hemisphere and the importance of getting out in the sun to absorb the UV rays.I liked this book for the detail and obvious care the Author has taken with his research. He also appears to be passionate about his chosen subject. To be able to put this very serious message across in a straightforward manner without losing readers along the way is certainly worth a mention.As an aging Boomer, interested in this subject, I can thoroughly recommend this book for readers of all ages.The downside is not one of content or delivery but one of presentation. There are some serious flaws in the formatting leading to acres of white space before and after chapters. I have been reading this on my Cloud drive and will amend my comment if this is not so evident on an actual Kindle.There are far too many typos and grammatical errors for my liking which is a shame considering this is a very valuable resource.

"If you are looking for a good read during your lunch break at work, this one might be a good one for you - it took me about 15 or so minutes to finish this one.If you think about the nature of a short story vs. a novel, the obvious difference is the short story has one heck of a lot less words.  No kidding, you might say?  Well, because of that fact, the author has to be really good - and fast - to capture your attention, define the problem / main story line, then wrap it all up for a conclusion vs. having the ability to drone on and on for 100,000+ words (kind of like the length of this sentence).  The author does a great job grabbing your attention and understanding what is going on - I quickly found myself thinking about this one on a deeper level and, a few hours after having completed it, I'm still thinking about the story: that tells me it's a job well done as we've all quickly forgotten many short stories we have read over the years.Without having a spoiler, this one is a bit depressing - but a survival-type scenario I could envision, especially given the state of the world today.  I could also see this one being expanded from a short story format to a longer novel / novella.  If you couldn't tell, I enjoyed this one and am looking forward to reading more from this author.",5.0

"Tamara is a woman who is looking for a way of escape from an abusive relationship with her fiance, Brad. Brad, a local thug, and his crew solicited (more like threatened) Tamara's assistance to commit a burglary at a local museum. Having had enough of Brad, his abusive ways, and their toxic relationship, Tamara solicits the help of a local counselor, Selene, to help her make her escape. Together, Selene and Tamara plot of course of action that will allow Tamara to stop the burglary and slip away from Brad forever. But first, she has to act as if she is going to go through with her part of the crime.Upon arriving at the museum, Tamara is dispatched to go inside the museum, turn off the security alarm, and open the door for Brad and crew. Hopeful that she will be able to slip away to call the police to stop the robbery, Tamara's plans are thwarted when Brad demands that she assist in the pillaging effort. Scrambling for what to do next, Tamara hies away to one of the upstairs offices and calls the police. Her plan is to quietly make her escape while the crew is being apprehended. Unfortunately, she is on the third story and cannot make her way out of the building before she hears the police sirens. Tamara is stuck; she can't get out of the building and she can't hide. Moving toward the window, Tamara considers her options: jump and plunge to her possible death or be sentenced to a jail term along with Brad, et al.Settling, Tamara makes her choice. Jump! She lands hard and hurts her ankle but manages to make it to the relative seclusion of nearby bushes. Now Tamara is really stuck because she realizes that there absolutely no way from her to escape from the museum which is surrounded by a 12ft fence. As she ponders her dismal fate, Tamara hears growling in the bush beside her. She turns and comes face to face...er...face to snout with a huge wolf with brilliant emerald eyes. Tamara's fate plummets from dismal to fatal. She sees her death in the face of the wolf. But fate has different plans for Tamara when the wolf turns into her savior. Fearing that she has lost her mind, Tamara ""hears"" the wolf tell her to ""Hold on"". She slides on his back, grabs onto to his fur, and he plunges them both over the fence.The wolf delivers Tamara to a forest and to safety. He's her hero who also happens to be much more than just a wolf.This was a solid introduction into the world of the Caedmon Wolves. In it we see a disenfranchised hero gain acceptance and an abused woman find love. Tamara and Devin were interesting characters and I liked the overall byplay between them. Although this story was an interracial romance (IR), Ms. Kirk did not make race the emphasis of the story. So many IR's place a heavy emphasis on race that it distills the impact of the actual story. However, it was nice to see one that focused on the story with only minute references to the race of the characters.I would have liked to see more conflict in the story. Devin and Darius fought quickly, Darius submitted, and then it was over. Elisa warned Tamara to be careful but there was no indication as to why. At some point I thought that Darius' mate would try to harm Tamara in some way but she did not. My assumption (at least I hope) is that the warning was general and will play out in later books in the series.Overall, I enjoyed the story. It was a sweet story and a quick and easy read.",3.0

"Cody is drawn to India and her rude demeanor when waiting for his ""fancy coffee"" at the coffe shop he regularly visits. Brad, the owner, takes notice and pushes him in her direction. A good hearted banter begins between the two. Cody providing humor and kindness and her regulary doubting her actions and his because many people are known to dislike her.These two begin to regularly see each other and the reader is provided with a meeting of minds and a love so powerful that kisses and sex scenes aren't needed for you to feel immence satisfaction and swoon watching their love story unfold.There was also a bittersweet quality that added to this story.

"I enjoyed the book but had to knock off a few stars for the end. It was such a stupid conflict and the way it was dealt with pissed me off. I also didn't like that there were no steamy parts. Some books it's understandable for there not to be any but this one wasn't one of those. There was way to much build up in darn near all of the chapters for such a letdown.And who the Hell older 23 hasn't heard the song Jack and Diane?

"This was entertainingly funny.  I enjoyed the boldness of Catherine on her wedding night.  It was great fun while reading Catherine's grand ability to stumble onto the world's number one mood killer.  That whole scene was fantastic from beginning to end.  I really enjoyed this book.  The series as a whole is truely better than I expected.  I would definitely suggest reading this if you like amusing substance to go along with the romance. I got a big kick out of Ethan's mother and her wedding night discussion.  Well, pretty much anytime she spoke was entertaining. Well worth a read.",4.0
"The Good:Love the sense of reality in which the author brings us the character. There are no dainty girls who never snort or get drunk. I liked the fact that she brings the every day life events into the book, like a hormonal woman during her monthly cycle, a broken tooth that needs an emergency visit to the dentist, the simple act of changing your contact lenses or a kid waking up in the middle of the night wanting to be cuddled.  This book was very realistic and very well writtenThe author delves in very delicate subjects that unfortunately happen more often than we know. Child abuse, being overlooked simply because of the social status of the abuser. Today's economy taking its tow on businesses.This book felt like a roller coaster. One minute I was laughing and the next I was crying. I literally felt my heart flutter several times and more than once I had to stop reading to clear my vision. I haven't read a romance this good in a while.The parallel story of Jondi, Vory and Thorn was a great addition to the book and gave me a little more inside on John's mind.The Bad:Why on earth (and this is for 99% of the romance books out there), the first time the hero says ""I am sorry"" the heroine falls at his feet and forgives him? What happened to the ""You have to work for it""?I understand John, I really do. I understand the reasons behind him hurting Livvy, but honestly, he got off the hook too easily! Although I would probably find him hard to resist too if I was Livvy...Overall, the good is so good and the bad is so insignificant that I would give it 5 stars or more! This was a fabulous book!",5.0
"This was such an awesome story. It had all the elements I enjoy in a great read - interesting characters, humor, entertaining dialog, a bit of angst and a whole lot of chemistry.Stephanie was a wonderful character to get to know. She was smart, hard-working and determined to succeed. She had my attention from the start and soon I was relating to her as if she was my best friend. I enjoyed how she handled herself under pressure - especially when Derek pulled out the Latin mojo.Derek. *sigh* Derek, Derek, Derek. What can I say about him? He was my half Puerto Rican, sexy businessman so closed off emotionally he could rival one of our Forts here in the island. Completely understandable after learning what he went through, but utterly heart breaking. I loved him from the moment he appeared on the page with that air of arrogance and then I adored him even more after learning his story and watching as he learned to let go, smile and be himself.Although the concept behind the story has been done many times before, it was refreshing to see this time around that the heroine stood up for herself and made her own decisions. I also enjoyed the way that Diane Alberts brought Stephanie and Derek together. Through their flirtatious dialog and their banter, it was easy to see that their connection was real.This is the first book by Diane Alberts I have read, but it certainly it won't be last. Faking It was a funny, sexy and romantic. All in all, a wonderful read.I received this title from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange of my honest opinion.",4.0
"Full disclousure, I have not read this book, but I have a reason why. I read the sample to see if I would like it and I found the writing to be somewhat awkward. I mean no disrespect to the author, but the writing could use some polish.From the opening paragraph of the book:&#34;Darkness engulfed the corners of the street and there was hardly any soul nearby. The occasional sound of the icy winter air whizzing through the leaves added to the eeriness. City hospital stood there staring at the street with a frown; its gray walls looking gloomy with intermittent lighting further adding to its spook.&#34;I could see how some fantasy enthusiast might see past any shortcomings, but I suggest that casual readers steer clear.",2.0
"While I was completely engrossed in this book all the way through, I was thoroughly disappointed in the ending.  With as much detail as was given throughout, I felt like the ending was just left so wide open.  Not sure if the author really wanted it that way, or didn't know where to go with things.  I hate open-ended stories anyway, but this just seemed like it ended WAY before it should have.  That being said, I did really enjoy the book, just wish there was more.",4.0

Her mom wants her to have a semi-normal life but, that's kind of hard to do when your in their line of work. Luckily for Jessie, she actually likes what she does. Little does she know her life is about to change when Lukas Scott walks in. His request seems like it shouldn't be terrible to complete. However, it comes with consequences that neither Jessie nor her mom saw coming. Innocent lives are at risk and their time to complete the task is minimal. Will Jessie and her mom be able to get the Sins back in the box?Jessie and Lukas both have their secrets. Lukas struggles with his on almost a daily basis. It is hard for him to stay in control. When a ghost from his past turns up, things get crazy. Jessie does her best to have her life and work at the agency. I felt like she didn't really get to do a lot of things kids her age do. I mean the seven sins were on the loose which made things harder. She is surrounded by the supernatural. Despite her mom telling her to stay out of it Jessie inserts herself into investigation. This leads to some very dangerous situations. Especially since Jessie is developing feelings for Lukas...and his time is limited.I do love the dynamic between Lukas and Jessie. Lukas with his old fashion self and Jessie very upfront and different from what he is used to. They are so perfect for each other it hurts. Since their time is limited things heat up quick between them. I loved it!! They fell fast and hard for each other.

Wellhauser (Author) has added Continuous Malignity into this first in the series sci-fi based Fortuna's Bastard (A Great and Continuous Malignity)While many will point to parts of the book they truly liked, I admired how David S. Wellhauser has woven a tale which leaves you engage at the end so when you start the next book in the series you'll know the characters as they have been developed so well in this the first of the series. Always a challenge to intertwine continuous malignity to the point you're looking forward to the next book in the series but David S. Wellhauser has successfully achieved this objective.It's easy for me to put myself in the main character Matt's shoes as I've experienced similar circumstances in my life and this makes for an engaging read from the start.

"This used to be a great place.  When I moved to Forty Acres years ago, I was thrilled to have great Italian food so close to me.  The veal, the gnocci, everything was out of this world.  Now the food is not that good.  Pizza has declined in quality over the last couple years.  Calamari is always soggy.  The pasta and sauces are just so-so.  

Now for the reason I will NEVER return.  I placed a phone order.  I was told twenty minutes.  I went to pick it up and got there 25 minutes after my call.  I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The restaurant was not that busy.  The man who rung me up and barely spoke English hovered over me while I signed my slip, to the point that I was uncomfortable.  When he saw the tip line had a zero on it, he huffed very loudly and gave me a dirty look like he wanted to fight or something.  If I was classless like him, I might have been upset and lost sleep over it.  But knowing I will never, ever return to this horrible place actually just made it quite funny.  And when I got my food home, it was again just bland and boring.  

I do not recommend this place at all anymore.  A year ago, I might have.  Two years ago I always did.  Now I recommend you avoid the average food and horrible, horrible service and lack of basic human manners and respect at all cost.",1.0
This book has a heavier emotion level than the previous books in that it's dealing with character turmoil and unresolved self guilt and anger.  When Angel and Mitch were introduced in the previous book with an air of mystery as to why they had such tension between them it stirred my curiosity and am so glad this author did not take half of this book to tell us why.  Drawing something out too long bores me and can become almost frustrating so this is well balanced keeping events moving at a good pace never leaving me to rush on just to get to the point.  It was a good conclusion to these books although sad to see it end.  That just means they'll make great rereads ;),4.0
"I have to say this is not the typical time period that I like to read about.  I got it when it was free and I am so glad I did!The story starts in San Francisco, 1857.  Still a very vigilante society then Della is accused of murder by another apothecary and decides to flee rather than attempt to tell her side of the story.  She sold ""medicines"" which were mostly harmless elixirs that she had made.  So she seeks passage aboard a ship, with a plan in mind she introduces herself as the wife of Kenton Bradford.Never having met before, Kenton goes along with the charade so as not to be embarrassed in front of a potential investor.  They soon realize that the plan that Della had to secure her way aboard the ship and then buy steerage passage wouldn't work.  His investors think that a wife makes him more settled and that scandal will stop everything.They meet bumps and issues along the way, but the story was quite plausible (which I think is very important) and I enjoyed it very much.  I would definitely recommend!",5.0

"This was a great book, I had the privilege to Arc the original book for Alexia. While I thought that the original book was good and reviewed it well, I had been upset over how the book ended. When I heard that it was being redone I was excited to ARC it again for her. This time the story was even better, I loved the characters and how they never truly gave up on each other even after all those years. I was glad that the essence of their personalities didn't change in the redo because I fell in love with them the first time around. Penny's strong nature after Seth broke her heart was a good way to feel connected to her, we all wish sometimes that after our heart is broken that we can see how it will make us stronger. Penny shows us how to do that in this story. Seth was a character that I felt sympathy for, trying to balance duty and what we want is a hard choice sometimes. We all want to to the best thing for everyone involved, but we become tempted by the easier way and trying to convince ourselves it was the best option. But in the end of this story, even through all the heartache and regret these two can seem to find their way back together again.If you read the first one and liked it, or wished it had turned out different then pick up this book and read it. It is different enough from the first book to make you happy that you did. If you didn't read the original book, then what are you waiting for, go get it!!!",4.0
"I really liked Dangerous Passion and was looking forward to seeing Drake and Grace again here in this short story, but I really have to wonder what LMR intended here with this story. It reads like an afterthought or even filler, like something to keep a fan occupied until the next novel.I was hoping to see this couple with a family, to maybe read a deeper epilogue, or have a feel-good type of final bit of news about Drake. I wanted something that felt like a sweet and sexy hug for him. Instead, we see that danger is still looking for Drake, no matter where he is. And maybe the last scene would have been exciting in a longer work, but here in this short story, it was unfulfilling, even ending the story very abruptly and disrupting my sense of happy closure for this couple.The download is 80 kindle pages, but the story ends on p. 46. Following the story are excerpts from Dangerous Passion, Dangerous Lover (Avon Red), and Dangerous Secrets (Avon Red). For me and even as a fan of LMR, this story was less than okay. It's not something I'd tell a friend she just had to read. In fact, even if you've read all this series, I can't honestly say that you'd be missing anything special by skipping this offering. It really adds nothing new or interesting or special to Drake's story. And that's sad because Drake was a pretty dynamic character.For me this story feels as if it were done just for the sake of it, done kind of half-heartedly and without any real purpose or thought. This short story did Drake, nor LMR for that matter, any justice. I'm really shaking my head on this one.",2.0

"I'm really shocked at how much I loved this book! It was a freebie for the kindle, so I picked it up knowing that it met my criteria of paranormal romance. I started reading it randomly and just could not put the darn thing down! I kept expecting the worst (as I've seen with free books before) but the book sucked me in completely. I stayed up late last night to finish it because I had to know how it ended. The characters were so developed and the storyline (while some people probably won't like it) was great for me. There was a great balance of smut to storyline to make this one of my rare 5 star books (something I'd pick up and read again). READ THIS BOOK!

"When it comes to love ... do you follow your heart ... or do what's expected?Becoming Mrs. Walsh follows twenty-six year old photojournalist Shoshana Thompson's journey to the altar as she plans her wedding to Andrew Walsh, the last of four brothers from a prominent Washington D.C. family to get married. Coming from a simple family lifestyle in Iowa, Shoshana feels like she doesn't fit in with the opulence and extravagance of the Walsh family, but knows that she can learn to live within their privileged world. But their relationship is not your typical one, Andrew is more often absent due to his top secret job, and his distant demeanor has Shoshana questioning their relationship, especially when she begins to have feelings for a man that is definitely off limits. As her wedding day approaches, Shoshana's mixed emotions will leave her with a decision to make ... is it really worth becoming Mrs. Walsh or should she follow her heart?In her debut novel, author Jessica Gordon transports the reader to the extravagant city of movers and shakers in Washington D.C., where they follow Shoshana Thompson as she tries to fit into a new lifestyle that she is not accustomed to while establishing relationships with her future in-laws. This story has intricately interwoven and complex layers that simply draws the reader in from the start and captivates you with an intriguing storyline full of drama and enough twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages.I loved the character development in this story. Not only does the author feature the trials and tribulations that befall Shoshana as she struggles with her relationship and future with Andrew; the author also interweaves the relationships that she shares with the Walsh family: future mother-in-law Birdie and the three Walsh brothers and their wives. The dialogue and interactions between the characters are realistic, they come alive and leap off the pages. I found myself fascinated with the Walsh family and the core relationship theme of the story and how it relates to marriage, family and loyalty. I could relate to the relationship issues that comes with marriage and in-laws, the dynamics of this relationship is complex and universal for anyone who has traveled down this path in life. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the author's description of the opulence of the family's high society Washington D.C. lifestyle, it made my inner fashionista smile and sigh with wistful thinking. I could easily see this story as a made-for-tv movie on Lifetime. The only thing that made me groan is the anti-climantic ending. The author does a great job of making her readers yearn for more as they wait for the sequel to reveal what happens to Shoshana, Andrew and the rest of Walsh family members.Becoming Mrs. Walsh is an intriguing story of family relationships and marriage that will keep you thoroughly entertained.Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for my honest review.",4.0

Then, maybe she might want some girl action, which had me thinking &#34;Let's all get together and do it!  Some people might enjoy this garbage, but it ain't my thing!

"Went for lunch on a Monday.  Small place with a pleasant ambiance.  A smattering of 3 or 4 other couples.  The hostess/waitress was extremely friendly and was attentive enough.  They have a very affordable lunch special where you get a soup or salad plus an entree for $9.  (From the menu it appeared that entrees at dinner are around $12-$14ish without the appetizer.)  I tried the Tom Yum hot and sour soup with chicken.  Served hot on spice and temperature and very flavorful.  For my entree I had the Phad Kae Mao spicy noodles with chicken  Not the most flavorful dish ever and not quite as spicy as I hoped but it was still tasty and a hearty portion.  Overall a fine experience and probably about 3.5 stars, though I'll give them the round up due to the friendly service.

"Grade: A- (5 stars)Steampunk fantasy is an amazing genre! I personally read The first book by this author earlier, in my free time, i never got around to reviewing it. When i got a chance to read the second book I was all excited. It&#8217;s a great story, the world is created so well you can get lost in it, its wonderful. These a lot of conflict in this book, as the main character is currently imprisoned when we begin. Synn is such a great character. He&#8217;s brave, true and just trying to figure out how to do the right thing for his people. He&#8217;s so fleshes out, I really felt for him and his struggles in this book. He takes on so much, the Families, the Queens, all for his people. He&#8217;s a true hero. All the other characters in this novel were also wonderful, it&#8217;s nice to see an author who takes her time on all the characters, not just the main ones. This book was just as good as the first one, if not better in my opinion. It&#8217;s a lovely story, with action and sadness and struggle.

"Blood Faerie by India Drummond is an outstanding fantasy book.  I was hooked from the opening pages, and never encountered any loss of interest throughout the entire book.  This book is easy to read, the script is easy to follow, and the characters are well defined, brilliantly described, and contribute throughout the book.  This is a book I could not put down once I started reading it.  I spent several nights staying up way past my normal bed time to finish a chapter.  The last night I read until after midnight just to finish the book.

The lady told us where to sit. We sat down then she walked off. By this time it is almost 11:30... So we're waiting for her to come back. And we heard her scream at her coworker. Which was insane and very unprofessional. She came back and basically took all her anger out on us... my friends got sushi and I got Chicken Wings. My chicken wings took at least 35 minutes. So by then I told her I need them Togo. We needed to go back to work. I got very frustrated by then. Me and the coworkers will NEVER GO BACK!!",1.0

"EDIT: Spoke with the manager and it seems like I definitely had a one off experience, might be a new crew or something going on, and they were short handed. Going to be giving it another try, because I feel the manager truly meant what he said.



This is one of the worst experiences I've had. I placed an online order this morning to pick up my pizza at 1:15 PM, so I could get in and get out for my lunch.

I get there and there's nothing marking the pick up area except a little text on some glass near the oven. I tell them I'm here for my order and they tell me it was lost in the system, and they ask me what the pizza was. I tell them and they start to make it then tell me I can grab a drink. I tell the lady behind the counter I got a Mexican Fanta, but there are none. She tells me to take a coke instead and shrugs when I ask about Fanta. Fantastic :/

So then I get my pizza, and it's cooked right and my pizza, except I got the half pizza that includes a salad....and there's no salad. Couldn't afford to waste any more time (pizza took 10 minutes to get out)

So I got charged $11 for half a personal pizza, no salad, and a coke. There's also nowhere on my online order to request help or a refund.

"I really enjoyed this book even more then the first one. I am now in love with Monica too, I really warmed up to her in this book. I am not sure what the Loft actually is, what kind of club is it? that part was a little strange but that was such a small part. My heart did break when he decided to tell Monica that he was still in love with his ex-wife and that it will never change. I was shocked to learn that Jonathan has 7 sisters, wow. I liked the part about him owning her orgasms and them being exclusive when it comes to sex. Just like in the first book the sex scenes are hot, but actually they are even better in this book then in the first one. I enjoy how fun they are together, she is a wise ass and she has loosened him up with the day to day stuff. My heart broke a little more when Monica was lying in bed saying over and over again ""don't fall in love, don't fall in love"" I loved how worried he was that he had hurt her even though she wanted it he felt bad for leaving the bruises on her. I was so happy when they went to the black tie event together but I hated that his ex-wife was there and how he was affected by her and then Kevin and that terrible display made just to humiliate Monica, and then she runs out and Jonathan get sidetracked by Jessica but I was thrilled that he didn't stick around he actually went after Monica to take care of her, this is when I think he began to fall in love with her. He was so worried about her so he took her home so she could heal but then Kevin wont stop texting her, Darren is acting weird, and Gabby is needy as ever. Then to make everything worse for Monica Jessica decides to come to her workplace and sit at her station so Monica is forced to serve her and Jessica takes full advantage and tells Monica something that breaks her and of course this leaves us at the end of the book and Monica refusing to talk to Jonathan. Can't wait to read the next book.",5.0

"""The Confessions of Queen Cinderella"" examines the happily ever after part of Cinderella's story. What kind of ruler chooses a bride who can bring neither assets nor alliances to the marriage? Would the nobility really tolerate a commoner being elevated above their own daughters? How would an intelligent but uneducated teenager handle sudden immersion in court life?Anton Hur approaches the subject matter with outstanding writing ability and historical perspective.  Little details - an aside that the slipper was really fur and not glass (referring to a controversy among folklorists as to whether the word ""verre"" meaning glass was substituted for ""vair"" meaning a type of squirrel fur used in trim), mention of the precarious social position of a character with English and Huguenot background, and so forth - add depth lacking in most fairy tale retellings.I hope Hur's muse continues to inspire him. I enjoy superbly written historical fantasy: Ursula LeGuin's ""Lavinia,"" R A MacAvoy's ""Trio for Lute, Mary Stewart's Merlin series, and a few others.  Based on the quality of ""The Confession of Queen Cinderella,"" I wonder if Hur will someday produce a full length novel equal to one of these greats.",5.0

"Dark, gritty, seductive, and action-packed, Selling Out is a fantastic follow-up to Giving it Up. Though the stories are told in a similar style, this one is definitely my favorite. I relished the opportunity to spend more time with Allie, Colin, Philip, and especially Shelly.From it's first moments, the book kept me glued to the pages. As the author peels away Shelley's layers, giving the reader more insight in to who she is, she peels away layers of plot, revealing twists, turns and surprises. We get to know the characters as well as the seedy Chicago underworld, and just when everything seems too dark, too impossible, there is a pin-point of light. But nothing in Shelly's world is simple...For me, the best part of the book is Shelly's character; I adore her. She is so incredibly broken, damaged, and dark, but for whatever reason, she keeps fighting for herself, for others, and for redemption. She is complex, subversive, intelligent, and beautiful. I am drawn to her, like the people around her, especially Luke. I was taken by their electric connection, and the mystery surrounding Luke.I enjoyed this book immensely. The story, the characters, the emotion and the author's perspective left me breathless and wrung-out. I was completely sucked in and though I was satisfied by the ending, I was disappointed when it was over.*I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for a fair and honest review.See this review and more at TattooedBookReview dot com!",5.0

"In this engaging Civil War Novella Carrie Fancett Pagels takes us back to the year 1862 where the battle between the states rages on.  So many men were taken from their families never to return again, some were even forced against their will to fight for a cause that was not their own. Such was the case of Matthew Scott, a young man that headed a very successful Theatrical Group in Ohio.Matthew Scott was horrified to find that he, the son of a Copperhead had been viciously conscripted into the Confederate Army. Matthew never wanted to fight in this war, but now it seems he has no choice. After being wounded Matthew is sent to Shirley Plantation and there he meets the most beautiful angel of mercy he has ever seen. Would it make a difference in the way he feels if he knew her secret?Angelina Rose is staying at Shirley Plantation under the guise of being the widow of a Carter relative.  Even though she is a former slave to look at her no one would guess she is of African descent. Angelina had a job awaiting her as a seamstress in Ohio with a Theatrical Group but she couldn't bear to leave her sister's enslaved children behind. Even more she knows God has told her to wait. When the Confederate Army sequesters the Plantation to use it as a hospital, Angelina's hope to leave all but disappears. While helping the wounded Angelina meets a handsome soldier that seems to tug at her heartstrings. Will God use the unfortunate circumstances of a wounded man to bring about Angelina's deliverance?Wow! What a truly remarkable story from this new author. I sincerely enjoyed everything about this story; it is so rich in history it shows that Ms. Pagels did a lot of extensive research for it. The setting of Shirley Plantation is a real place that survived the war and it's still around today. After reading this I'm convinced that I need to take a road trip to Virginia. Thank you Ms. Pagels for sharing this enthralling story with us, I am looking forward to reading more of your books in the very near future.",5.0
"I preordered a Kindle Touch, but as I realized once it arrived, I didn't have anything to put it in.  So for the first month I had it, I kept it in the original box.  That's a little awkward to carry around.  So when I saw this on Vine, I decided to get it, despite that it's pink.In short the product does what it's supposed to do.  The Kindle Touch fits inside it and is cushioned against damage.  Now since a Kindle Touch is at least a hundred bucks, I'm not putting this thing through a lot of torture tests, like having an elephant step on the case to see if the Kindle is destroyed.

"Actual rating is 4.5 stars.I received this book for free from IFB Tours in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.This book may be unsuitable for people under 17 years of age due to its use of sexual content, drug and alcohol use, and/or violence.My Initial Reaction...After already loving Dance For Me, I wasn't at all surprised that I enjoyed In Harmony just as much. I was pleasantly surprised, however, by how different the story felt. Despite being set in the same place, time, and even including many of the same characters, by simply shifting the point of view Helena Newbury managed to tell a very different kind of story. And I loved it.The Characters...Karen is the character I would have voted least likely to star in a steamy romance, and yet she pulls it off beautifully. She's been working hard her whole life to get into the NY Phil Harmonica, sacrificing normal relationships and childhood experiences to do so. Karen's the ultimate over-achiever, with an uber successful father's expectations to live up to. I loved seeing her try to navigate her father's expectations with her efforts to find her own path. Karen's also never been in a relationship; her only sexual experience comes from a selection of bodice-rippers hidden under her bed, alongside her dildo. While Karen may be a virgin it's not for lack of interest, just opportunities. Her inexperience forms a humorous backdrop and allows Newbury to stretch out the sexual teasing to its height.Just when Karen is reaching the culmination of all her hard work her duet partner for her senior recital is injured and can't perform with her. If she wants to graduate, Karen has to put her faith in Connor, the electric-guitar playing, class-skipping, notorious bad-boy. Connor is exactly what you'd expect from a bad-boy: he's ridiculously sexy, talented, cocky and has a notorious reputation with the ladies. And yet there's more going on below the surface. I enjoyed getting to know the deeper side of Connor and appreciated that, while he came with his own set of issues, Newbury didn't write him as a totally broken man either. He needs help, but not rescuing.I was thrilled too see characters I loved in Dance for Me continue to figure prominently within In Harmony, but their struggles are a subplot and you can easily pick up In Harmony without reading Dance for Me. If you have read it though, you're in for a treat as these excellent characters continue to develop.The Story...In Harmony revolves around Karen and Connor's struggle to graduate - which means Connor must pass his classes, Karen must deal with some issues of her own, and they both must figure out how to make a cello and an electric guitar work together. Like in Dance for Me, I loved the way music moved the story forward. Newbury is very gifted in the ways she employs music to express emotions, heighten tension, and tell a story of their own. Some of the best moments were when Karen and/or Connor were playing - it became this tangible way to visualize their journeys as individuals and in their relationship.I loved that In Harmony didn't duplicate the insta-love that we saw in Dance for Me. Instead we see a relationship that develops slowly, through closely working together over a long period of time. In fact, I think Newbury beautifully complicated the insta-love that had so bothered my in Dance for Me by showing us those relationships in their progression, going through some troubles of their own. Since this story is told exclusively from Karen's point-of-view, which is pretty observant but also hesitant, it's a very different perspective that we saw before.Concluding Sentiments...In Harmony has really well-developed characters and intertwines music beautifully to propel the story forward. It's a fairly simplistic plot, without a lot of mystery, but it's thoroughly enjoyable. Once I started, I devoured In Harmony and can't wait to read more from Helena Newbury.",4.0
"I've just read ""Muscling Through"" by J.L. Merrow, based upon the recommendation of a couple of people on a book forum, whose opinion I trust.This was a very quick read, since it is a novella rather than a full-length novel. But it was also a surprisingly satisfying one, for its length!(Yikes, I just re-read that last sentence, which could certainly be taken to mean something that was TOTALLY not intended!)I wasn't sure I was comfortable with Al's voice as he began telling the story, when he came across as being a bit slow on the uptake. (Which of course is totally hypocritical of me, since I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer myself.) But in no time at all, I grew to like this character; he's a real sweetheart, and it was refreshing to hear someone express himself so very directly.Now, I also had my doubts as to whether these two people---who, intellectually speaking, are operating on completely different levels---could have a successful long-term relationship. But by the end of the story the reader is rooting for the two fellows wholeheartedly, and totally believes that they will make a go of it. Is such a relationship possible in real life? Hmmmm, I'm still not sure---I think it rather unlikely---but nevertheless you'll believe it can be true as you read this story.This tale also had a lot more sex in it than the romances I usually read. Wait, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Heh. But hey, it worked---though the question is how to classify it. Does it veer a bit toward erotica, or is it still simply a romance?Oh, I should add that I loved how this story began. It was very funny---I've re-read the first chapter four or five times already.So, surprisingly (because this isn't really like the sort of thing I usually read) I give this a glowing recommendation, though I do wish it were longer and a bit more complex. I appreciated the amusing bits, but the story contained a few genuinely touching moments as well, that really got to me. Give it a try.",4.0

She seemed to accept it just like one accepts the sky being blue. Normally, one would be furious that they've been lied to their whole life. However, I'm very excited to see where the character ends up at the end and whether she gets the revenge she wants or not.",4.0

"Passion and Pain is the first in a series of books about a group of teenagers with a passion for performance arts and their first steps in the world of love, lust and alcohol. Leading with Elena, her best friend Sebastian and the loyal set of friends she makes at her new school you are swept along on her journey as she tries to juggle true love and her determination to succeed at school. The book has a great balance of both the performance arts side of things, and the high school drama that propels the plot along.It is refreshing to be given characters that value their virginity and know the importance of hard work and Elena and her friends certainly tick all the boxes here. Her sworn enemy, Letitia is feisty and manipulative from the word go, but it is a shame you don't get more of a backstory to her evil nature as it feels like there is something more there. Perhaps that is something that will be developed in the sequel, Bittersweet, which is out in 2013. The ending of Passion and Pain certainly begs for more, as Sebastian surely can't keep his dirty little secret from Elena for long.Reviewed by Elizabeth Wright on behalf of BestChickLit.com",4.0
"Kidnapping, revenge killing, moonshine and drugs are all illegal. One would think these would all be bad, no matter the circumstances. However, Ms. Gala turns these concepts upside down in some ways. The drug selling is still bad, but the others are all okay.Stewart ""Stunt"" Folger is essentially a forest ranger checking on the lands in the Appalachian mountains. He gives most of the mountain men or ""hill folk"" a wide berth. It's not so much because he's gay, but because he's paid by the federal government. The hill folk hate the government more than anything else. Honestly, their points are kind of valid. The hill folk hold to their own brand of justice code and morale. To the city folks, it's plum crazy. After listening to the hill folk for a while, it starts to make sense. Even without partaking in their moonshine, there is a sort of straightforward logic to their madness.Unfortunately for Stunt, he trips over Alex who is hell bent on killing a drug dealer. Alex is avenging a family member. From a hill folk viewpoint, kin is important and this is just. From a legal perspective, Stunt is floored. Stunt is held against his will by Alex until the drug dealer can be killed. Everything goes to hell in a handbasket.This is one of those crazy stories where there is a pause and the narrator states, but there's more! Alex and Stunt generate some of the most harebrained ideas. It's a wonder they aren't hurt more or killed. Ms. Gala constantly pokes fun at her characters as they acknowledge how flawed their plans are and how incredibly stupid. Alex and Stunt aren't righteous. They aren't bad. They are two guys doing their best with the hand they are dealt. This makes them more relatable and at times, endearing. The fact that some of their cockamamie plans work despite getting caught is mind blowing. But not everything goes the way it should, which is why Ms. Gala is an awesome writer. She throws in curveballs so nothing is too easy nor is it beyond belief.During all this action, Alex and Stunt learn more about each other, even in the biblical sense. Boy, is their sex hawt! It's a little bit of dubious consensual bondage, which is all sorts of messed up with the kidnapping theme. Stunt and Alex both happen to be versed in the BDSM world which is lucky for them. Especially since Stunt is a bottom and Alex is a Top. Well, Stunt is a mouthy pushy bottom who deserves what he gets. At times, even I wanted to put a gag in his motor mouth. Ms. Gala certainly cranks up the heat between these two as they get their freak on. It's fortunate the barn they play in didn't burst into flames with their wicked fornication. This suspense m/m romance is recommended to kinky readers who have a twisted sense of humour.Reviewed by BookAddictfor TheRomanceReviews.com",4.0

"As a mom, what I liked about this particular book is the author's use of personal stories. After all, stories engage the reader far more than a lecture, and these stories were real...and relatable. There are questions and worksheets to help teens really think about what they want, identify their strengths and passions, identify and consider changes they can make and accept changes they cannot, and raise their self esteem and motivation.I also liked that the principles within this book apply to anyone of any age (myself included) but that they are worded in such a way that speak on a level the young reader can relate to. Not speaking over their head or in long-winded lecture format, but simple to the point statements that are gentle, yet effective.I really love Dr. Katz's style and will continue to buy more books in this series as it will be a great opportunity for us, as a family, to read and discuss these concerns and how to work through them. With the help of these books, it will be easier to approach challenging subjects that would otherwise not be discussed",5.0
"I have read all of Darcy Burke's full lengths and really enjoyed them and was happy to see she had a novella out and I was quite happy with it!  Jocelyn Renwick sees her late mothers necklace on a lady of the ton while acting as a chaperone at a ball and it spikes her curiosity since it was stolen and never recovered.  With her impulsive, bold nature she asks about the necklace and where it came from and gets a answer that she knows is false.  At the same ball she garners the attention of Daniel Carlyle, former constable and new viscount.  He was mentored about the ways of society since he never expected to be a viscount and the earl that mentors him just happens to be the man that has Jocelyn's belongings.  Not sure who to believe, the earl or Jocelyn, sends Daniel back to his roots in a quest for the truth.  Unfortunately, the truth turns out to be the worse kind and it endangers not just him, but also Jocelyn and the hope for a future together.As with most novellas, I wish this was just a bit longer so we could have had more time to see the relationship develop between Jocelyn and Daniel but even so, I thought the length was done well.  The instant attraction sends sparks flying and the action keeps this couple coming back together.  Lies are told but truths are quickly revealed as well which I appreciated.  I liked how Daniel has been a constable and inherited a title he never expected to have or want and this is an area I would have liked just a bit more about, but again, it worked well within this novella.  Daniel is smart, loyal and confident and a wonderful foil to Jocelyn and her bold nature. You know who the villain is but how it all unraveled was a delight.  This novella has it all--action, romance, love and passion.  We get just enough glimpses of one of the upcoming heroes and I am very anxious to see how Ms Burke redeems him!  Lovely story for a lovely price.  4 stars",4.0

"I have been reading James Patterson's books since Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider and still look forward to each new one.  I especially like the books in series -- Alex Cross, The Women's Murder Club and now Private.  His collaboration with Maxine Paetro is better than some of the other collaborations he has done.  I enjoyed reading Private # 1 Suspect very much and didn't want to put the book down.  I find the main character, Jack Morgan, very likeable and enjoy the cast of characters and the whole operation of Private.  As with his other books, there really is no lead-in time to the story -- it hits the ground running and doesn't let up.  The short chapters keep it flowing and keep you wanting to read more.Private # 1 suspect has several plots woven throughout and brings them all to conclusion but leaves room for the next plot to spin off so you are waiting to see what will happen to the characters and their relationships in the next book.  If you are a fan of James Patterson you won't want to miss this one.

"What can I say? I am hooked on this series. Brooke Page has a way of telling a story that captivates you and sucks you in. Tyler is pulled in so many directions, but all roads always leads back to Becca. I'm so glad that Becca found her backbone and now isn't afraid to stand up for herself and what she wants. The love they have for one another is tender one minute and explosive the next (in the best kind of way)! I love Alpha Tyler, and I love all the secondary characters. ok, not ALL of them, some are real pieces of work!!! What do I regret about this book? Good question. I regret that it ended. I regret that I have to wait for book 3. What I don't regret is reading it, and neither will you!!!!!",5.0
"We meet Camille and Ahmad, thinking we are going to get a bit of happiness. Beep, wrong answer. We get a love story with a few twists and turns and some left field action. Do you think you can be a ryder? Are you ready to be a ryder? Do you have what it takes?Meet Camille. Young girl so in love and all she can see is the love she has for Ahmad. Ahmad loves her the same way but of course life comes knocking and raging. Ahmad gets locked for fifteen years. Camille is committed to be with her man but what happens? You already know or do you? What you think will happen does and a few things you don't see coming. Now throw in some other characters and what happens when the foolishness of others come into play.Did we meet any ryders? Depends on your definition. Did they have the potential to become more than what we saw? Camille, India, Shakir, Ahmad, Scorpio, and Maurice are definitely some characters you can relate to on some level but also want to shake and harm them. You get some viewpoints from them that make sense but then you look at them like you can't be serious right now.",3.0

"This is a well crafted thriller/mystery about two twins - Jeremiah and Isaiah - whose mother sacrificed her own life for theirs during World War II. Reunited decades later, the brothers (one a priest and the other a rabbi), embark on a perilous journey to Poland to discover who they truly are. As they begin to uncover the appalling secret of their chilling heritage, their very existence is threatened yet again. Will they survive? Of course, I can't say. But the story has a very surprising and unexpected ending. At God's Mercy is an entrancing read that raises heartrending questions regarding human nature, our belief systems and our very existence.The story had every element a good story should have. A stimulating plot, attention to detail, but best of all fleshed out, well-written and well-rounded character development. This absorbing and attention-grabbing work had me engaged from the beginning. The story flows from scene to scene effortlessly, and the author shows exceptional skill when it comes to storytelling.It's one of those rare stories that come along that makes you want to read it non-stop until you get to the end. I'm giving nothing further away here. And this, I hope, will only add to the mystery of this intriguing story.A highly recommended read!",5.0

"I thought that this book was a wonderful autobiography on the life of the author, moving from the poverty he lived through as a young child to reaching toward his dream of becoming a lawyer.  The book is very well-written; the reader can become so engrossed in the book that s/he feels like s/he actually is experiencing the events as they unfold throughout the book.  The story is told in an easy-to-read format that would appeal to readers of nearly any level without being so easy that it becomes boring.  If you like autobiographies and/or historical books, then you definitely would enjoyEverything Will Be All Right.  I would recommend this book both as one to read purely for your own enjoyment and as an educational tool for classes such as political science, social work, and other related subjects.  Definitely worth the money!",5.0
"Carly is so excited when she scents her mate ~ after all, nothing smells better to this little bunny shifter than summer rain & dandelions.  But when she catches up with the scent trail...it leads her right to a hottie lion, who just happens to be groping a skinny assed blonde human!  So even when he obviously scents her as his mate, she makes tracks and splits...Neal is confused...he's finally found his mate, and he just wants to get down to the buisnes of making kits...only Carly won't give him the time of day!  It's been months, and she's been playing the avoidance game...so he finally has to stalk her down & they get busy marking one another...only for her to flee first chance she gets.  But then Neal finds out there is a REAL threat against his mate, and he's got to get to the bottom of the problem with his little 'darlin and keep her close.So I'm sucker for shifters.  I buy them up when they appeal...this was one of those buys, popped up on Amazon when I doing a search, so thought what the heck, sounded interesting, so tried it.  First, it's NOT the first in the series.  I don't have a problem with that, but I know many do, so want to mention it.  Second, want to mention it totally leaves you with a cliff hanger at the end...not with this couple, but with the overall story ARC, so if you hate that, yeah, you're warned.This was a quick read...and I like quick, sometimes corny shifter reads sometimes...but this one kinda fell short of the mark.  Don't get wrong, it was awful, it just wasn't...THAT good.  I hated the BIG misunderstanding between Carly & Neal, and that he was too slow on the uptake to figure out that she wasn't having his ass as long as he was letting other women hang all over him.  I hated that she let months go by with him chasing after her and didn't make herself clear.There were some funny scenes, and a little bit of a suspense story in there, but yeah, wasn't really into it...the biggest theme I got was the blonde bimbo hanging on Neal's arm.  I won't be buying any more in this series.  If you've read some of these, and think I'm off base, or others are better, let me know!I wasn't impressed enough with this one to spend my $$ on another.If I gave stars, I'd give it a 2 1/2.Celia Kyle (Author)> Visit Amazon's Celia Kyle PageFind all the books, read about the author, and more.See search results for this authorAre you an author?

"I grabbed this one a while back, and only got around to reading it today. I must say, I wish I hadn't waited so long. Back when I lived in Florida, I gamed once a week with a small group of people that made Friday nights epic, and this book was just like revisiting all of that profane hilarity. Thank you so much for the trip down memory lane - I'll be grabbing more of your stories soon, just to enjoy the memories!This is a brief look into a couple of the characters in the series, not a complete overview. Cooper is foul-mouthed, and Julian is trickier than one might think. I love that the story gives glimpses of the people 'behind' the characters as well as the characters themselves. This was an awesome, short read, and I'm tempted to go read it over again, just so I can be prepared to throw a monkey wrench into my DM's plans (I play a half-Elf) the next time we meet. Well done, Mr. Bevan, well done.",5.0

"In a lot of ways, &#8220;Seven Beyond&#8221; follows life as it happens. John, a merchant&#8217;s son, is brought into the fold as something of a musical apprentice and Felicity, an apprentice who gives lessons, has an overwhelming attraction to him. Atrium writes a romance that may be ill-fated but starts out quit courtly. There&#8217;s a firmly implied class structure that carries down from Lady Drasher to a merchant&#8217;s son. The structure of the world is mirrored in the characters and while some of what is written seems to have a touch of the modern world there is a taste of the medieval. &#8220;Seven Beyond&#8221; is a masterfully constructed story.Atrium&#8217;s settings are a step back in time reminiscent of the greats of science fiction. These characters are a world apart from us and their freedom or lack thereof in this somewhat foreign and somewhat familiar world is enticing and speaks to Atrium&#8217;s creativity. I have read other novels by this author and there is a continuity of feeling.The plotting of &#8220;Seven Beyond&#8221; is perhaps not traditional but readers won&#8217;t care. This is a story that won&#8217;t let go once it has you. Atrium&#8217;s work is unique and takes on a spectrum of emotions. If you like science fiction and eclectic tales, &#8220;Seven Beyond&#8221; is the novel for you.",5.0
I got this book as a free download and I really liked it.  It was a nice read with likable characters and plenty of ups and downs you expect in a romance novel.  The only thing that I did not care for too much was the way the main character would talk to her when he was upset with her.  I do agree with some of the other reviews that the end feels rushed but overall I found it to be an enjoyable read and I had a hard time putting it down.,4.0
From the first page this talented author enthralled me with such depth of feelings I found I had to put aside all other activities and feast upon this book. You feel like your right there with the characters. This is a great book that is both science fiction and fantasy with a hearty dose of romance. I'd recommend it for readers old enough to read through violence and some sexual situations.,5.0
"South Beach Diet Deliver.  Anytime we hear south beach in the equation we automatically think about hard bodies from the men and soft toned bodies from the women.

The good carbs and good fats, lean protein and low fat dairy has always been confusing for me but I can understand it a little better after reading his book.",5.0
"I was visiting Philadelphia from out of town and staying at the nearby Hampton Inn, and looked up this place on Yelp. With a name like the Prohibition Taproom, and based on a couple of other reviews, I thought they might have good cocktails -- but I was mistaken! My friend's drink -- a rum punch -- was so strong she had to ask them to put more juice in it; and either I'm an alcoholic or they forgot to put any bourbon in my old-fashioned. However, the food was GREAT and once we switched to beer, we were very impressed with their selection of awesome local brews. The bartenders were friendly and accommodating and there was a relaxed, congenial vibe to the place. The one thing to be aware of, though, is that it *is* in a very industrial, out-of-the-way spot -- the desk clerk at the hotel advised us to ""not look like tourists or like we were lost"" while walking there.",3.0

"While looking for books on how to save your marriage for a friend of mine, I ran across this one.  Actually, the introduction section grabbed my attention quickly and helped me realize this is the first book anyone should read because of logical reminder that &#34;Knowing What to Do is Never Enough&#34;.  If you are looking for ways to save your marriage, obviously marital problems have most likely been a part of life for you for a long time.  You probably have tried various suggestions and read numerous books with little to no results and may just figure your marriage is hopeless.  However, you may think you know some of the things mentioned in this book, and you are probably right.  However, just because you might already know about some of the suggestions, you should never dismiss any idea because you've already learned it or even tried it.  Knowing isn't enough when in a battle to save your marriage.  Each suggestion provided should be seriously considered even if it is &#34;nothing new&#34;... whether it helped or not in the past is not relevant to your current struggles.  Don't just look for new ways to learn how to save your marriage.  If you reconsider trying something again, you might just be surprised by success.",5.0

Although set against the background of the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, it is a story that might take place anywhere in the world today.When diplomacy fails, highly placed personages in the British Government determine to take matters in hand by organizing a force to act ""out of channels,"" with disastrous results.Mr. Fleming's novel is a thought provoking tale of abuse of intrigue, abuse of power, deceit, and betrayal. In these days of terrorism and counter-terrorism, it is all too plausible. Altogether, a very engaging and though provoking read. I look forward to Mr. Fleming's next effort.",4.0

"Let me star off with; I ADORE the cover!I&#8217;ve read a lot of book about the innocent girl heading off to college with her mind set on change, and most of them have been really good and they all turn out completely different. 3:AM has a really good set up, but it&#8217;s so fixated on the sex Baya is not having it kinda overshadows the rest of story.She meets Bryson and sparks fly, but when she realizes he&#8217;s the campus player and that she has the hot&#8217;s for him everything he say is a sexual innuendo in her head. The most common, innocent sentence has her head reeling with &#8220;What did he mean? Did he mean it literally or is there a hidden meaning? Does he get a boner by just looking at me as I do him?&#8221; I get that she wants to be viewed as something else than a 15 year old little sister but it gets down right ridiculous.I almost DNF&#8217;ed it after I&#8217;ve read a quarter but Bryson and his past had me keep reading. He&#8217;s without a doubt the only thing that makes this book bearable. Well, he and Laney but she has such a small part she doesn&#8217;t make much of a difference.  Bryson is a good character, not a phenomenal one but a good and all over likable one.In the last half of the book when Baya starts looking for something else than for somebody to &#8220;defile her&#8221;  out comes a pretty okay story. It&#8217;s a bit chopped up and it all happens very fast at the end but it&#8217;s actually not that bad.",2.0
"After loving Enough Isn't Everything so much, I knew this one would be just as good. I was anxious to to read this and was not in anyway disappointed whatsoever. Everything She Needs picks up right where the first one ended.Lily is back in London for the holidays and is hoping her friends can help her mend her broken heart. She just wants to get away from the drama that has taken place during her first semester at college. She has come to terms with the things she has done wrong and doesn't want to be the person she has become lately. She is completely in love with Alfie but doesn't want all the heartache that comes with it. Lily gives into temptation and allows herself one night with Alfie and then takes off back to Miami after realizing it was a mistake.Alfie is determined to have Lily and he tries his hardest to get another chance. Alfie is trying to be honest with Lily so he makes a confession about another female and Lily has to figure out if she can deal with it. One other confession about his feelings for her will leave Lily questioning if she should push him a way or not.Lily and Will's relationship is still in a slump ever since the &#34;situation&#34; took place they seem to have lost the comfortness they once had with each other. Lily's best friend Jack from London definitely fills in the void of not having Will in her life. Jack will do whatever is in his power to make Lily feel whole again.There is a lot going on in this book, it doesn't entirely concentrate on Lily and Alfie's relationship. You meet new characters that you will love, especially Jack, who is sweet, hot, and witty. Lily develops into a more mature young women focusing on her studies and music. Something is always getting in the way of Lily and Alfie having an actually relationship, keeping them from having their HEA. I was so jealous of Lily, I might take the broken heart if I could be surrounded by as many swoon-worthy men as her. I loved this book just as much as the first one and I am hoping that Lily and Alfie can get their HEA in the final book. Highly recommend.",5.0

"Death Rites - Hawaiian Bad SpiritsRating: 4 of 5Author: D.V. BerkomFormat: KindleAfter narrowly escaping death in Alaska, Kate Jones finds herself again on the run.  Unfortunately, bad spirits have a tendency to find her wherever she goes and soon, death follows her once more.  But something is different, and those who are after her are out for something much different than money or revenge and Kate suddenly finds her world and all she knows turned upside down.In this installment of the series, Berkom introduces a bit of a twist in the Kate Jones series.  I'm reluctant to give away too much of the plot line but lets say I think that this deviation from the Jones formula was a nice surprise which added mystery elements to her patented action movie style writing.  I do feel sorry for poor Kate who is definitely a magnet for bad luck. I don't think her life will ever slow down!Fans of the series will enjoy this chapter of the story.  Next up is Touring for Death. Well have to see what trouble Kate gets herself this time!

"3.5 StarsThis is one of those book where I liked both the characters and who they are at this point in their lives. I like their situation and what brought them together at this point in time, but what disturbs me is the inability to get over, get past stuff that happened 9 years ago when they were in high school. I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m very much a believer that when something in your life goes wrong you deal with it and move or you get therapy and figure out. People carry too much baggage around and let it impact their lives today; it&#8217;s not healthy and at times it&#8217;s just flat out childish. So, while I enjoyed Kiss Me At Midnight I didn&#8217;t love it because both characters were too hung up on what happened in high school making them both appear somewhat immature for the responsible adults they both are suppose to be.Ashley Hanes and Ethan Pierce were best friends in high school until one day Ethan refused to talk or do anything with Ashley anymore. She&#8217;s never quite gotten over the rejection. Ethan&#8217;s young heart was shattered when he saw Ashley kissing another boy when he had finally made up his mind to pursue her and tell her how he felt. Cutting off all communication was like cutting out a piece of his heart but he did it and he moved on and away as fast as he could. When they meet nine years later on New Year&#8217;s Eve thing get very interesting, very quickly.It was easy to like both Ashley and Ethan; they both have accomplished a great deal in their lives and are happy and productive. However, they have this history that neither one of them can seem to let go. One thing that is quite evident is the steamy chemistry circling around them. There is no denying they want each other and decide to spend one night getting each other out of their system while Ethan is in town for the holidays. I enjoyed their time together and the way they worked through their past issues and rediscovered each other as adults. The obvious friendship they had is still present but soon they both realize feelings they didn&#8217;t want creeping in and causing some confrontations and hurtful verbal exchanges.I enjoyed this story but I think it could have been so much better had the characters not been so caught up in the past. Neither one seemed to want to focus on what they have accomplished; they were more interested in dredging up the past over and over. A good read that could have been so much better.Review copy provided for an honest review.",3.0

"I read this short after reading Angel Unborn in Malice, Mischief and Men. I was totally hooked.  It overlaps Angel Unborn' s end, telling the story from the H' s pov--giving additional depth to the story and quenching my curiosity about what happened on the other side.  I have bought the next book, Angel Unleashed, and have a feeling I am going to be looking for a preorder button for the next one. It's not often I find the magical combination of humor, suspense, and engagement leading to the ""I can't put it down"" response. Andris Bear brings it with this series.",5.0
"Blood Iris is a dark collection of well written tales from some of the newest and freshest voices in the genre.  From Annie Bellet's  'Til Human Voices Wake Us which presents a psychic with secret to the utterly delightful tale of an elderly witch in ""Monkey Business"" by Elle Casey all the way through to the dark and disturbingly beautiful vampire love story by SM Reine ""Monsters"".  The stories in between will make you want for more - particularly ""Mama's sword"" by Ada Hoffmann.  ""The door in Red Hook "" By Joshua Grover-David Patterson will leave you eyeballing random doorways and wondering.  There are many more tales, all full of merit and while I can't say I adored every story, I will admit that they were all well written and held my interest until the end.  Not something I can say about most anthologies.",5.0
"I don't usually like ebook downloads that contain a short story and a longer promo; I usually find them to be a tactless way of pushing the reader to go buy something else by the author.  However, the short story included in this download was actually a very nice length, and I surprisingly thought that the promo fit well into the download, almost continuing the short story in a way.The short story follows Garrison Gage as he is asked by a teenage neighbor he doesn't really know to investigate the disappearance of this teen neighbor's girlfriend.  Mr. Gage unwillingly agrees and starts to get back into investigation, something he had given up long before.It's a really nice intro to the Garrison Gage series, and it was so well-written that it didn't feel rushed or too short at all.  I loved the persona of Garrison, as he is a crippled man with a full sense of sarcasm, which was quite witty and humorous at times.The short story only takes up about 1/3 of the download, though; the other 2/3 is the first few chapters of the official Book 1 of the series.  It gives you more insight into Garrison's past and how he ended up in the town he is currently living in.  It also really does draw you in and makes you want to keep reading, something that I may just do by buying the official book.Overall, I really enjoyed this short story so much that I wanted more; and the fact that the promo for the first book was included satiated that desire.  I think this shows promise as a mystery series, and I can't wait to see what the author does next!  I highly recommend checking out this short story, because I really enjoyed the mystery.Warnings - Language, Mild Sexual Violence References; Mild Violence",5.0

Garrick is also a wonderful character. So full of feelings of love and protectiveness. And the storyline about Bobby Kramer and his dad was great. A dark element in a story is wonderful.

"You know I love Mary Calmes and I know what I am getting with her,  but this story didn't quite work for me.I loved both the men, who are standard Mary Calmes types - Weber,  the drifter/cowboy/bull rider and Cyrus, or Doc, the charming,  slighter, more openly gay man.  I liked the opening chapters a lot,  but everyone just loved Weber way too much,  and it all felt a bit too perfect for me...  I know she writes fairy tales, but in this one I couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough.  I've read lots of her books and will read more... but this one wasn't a hit for me.",3.0

This book was not what it was hyped up to be. There were times I couldn't get past a certain sentence because of grammatical errors. The thought the reason for waiting on the book was because it was being edited? I gave it 2 stars because it did start off good but I got lost in the middle. I guess because the story line of certain characters I didn't care for and those characters to me didn't make sense in the book. The first book was soooooo good!

"Oh my gosh, this book was SOO worth the wait! It was wonderful from start to finish, even more so than &#34;Try&#34;! I loved Logan, because even though he was usually so confident and self-assured, Tate was his weakness and he was so vulnerable when it came to him. But never weak in a bad way, weak in a &#34;you are my everything and I would do anything for you&#34; kind of way. Their love was so incredible and so strong. I really loved how they were able to repair their relationship so quickly after things had temporarily gone sour (sorry, no spoilers today lol). Tate became a little more confident in this one, but he had his moments where he wasn't so sure. They both did, and I even got a little teary eyed a couple of times when things got hard for them. This is a couple you can't help rooting for!I already liked Cole a little bit from the first book because he'd stood up for his brother in college (even after Logan had literally forced Cole to accept him haha). But &#34;Take&#34; really highlighted him as a really good guy. I even came to really like his wife Rachel, funky fashion sense and all. The downers to this book? We find out what kind of people Tate's parents really are (just UGH) and finding out how horrible Logan's ex, Chris, was. Scum of the freaking Earth. But Ella Frank is an excellent writer and everything comes together really well. And now we know Logan and Tate's love is real and solid. But reading that ending, I can't help but wonder if there's a part 3 in store. Could it really just end like that? I guess I could accept it if it did, but I wouldn't be opposed to buying a 3rd installment!P.S. If you thought the sex in &#34;Try&#34; was hot, then you might wanna pack a fan for this one!

"Well, I'm 30, but I'm not single, and yet - I WANNA GET MY ASS TO THE GATHERING! *winks* Celia Kyle writes snarky, sassy heroines that make me laugh out loud. The Wickham Sisters in her Alpha Marked series are completely nutty and I love them. The only thing better than the sisters? Their men. And those lucky bitches get not one, but TWO hot guys in each book. &#60;- That's the reason I want to get my ass to the gathering! Can you blame me?Scarlet, Gabriella and Whitney all have their own hang ups. Scarlet's is that she resents being summoned to The Gathering where she'll have to sit through the werewolf version of speed dating and then be mated off to an Alpha Pair of wolves. Lack of free will can piss anyone off, so I don't blame her. Gabriella's problem is that she's had a line of jerky ex-boyfriends who have told her she's frigid. Now she worries no one will truly want her. Whitney's problem is that she shouldn't have been summoned to the Gathering at all! Her sisters carry the &#34;Mark&#34; that identify them as a future mate for an Alpha Pair, but she doesn't. Each book is a quick, delightful read with super smexy scenes (so you probably shouldn't read them at work). Whitney's book was my favorite story line wise, but my favorite men came out of Scarlet's book. And good news for you all - Whitney released today! So if you like your men alpha and sexy, your women quick witted and cute, and your stories to leave a smile on your face - then this series is for you. ;D",5.0

"Heavy Metal is book 2 in the Goddesses Rising trilogy by Natalie J. Damschroder.  This book starts out three years after Sam left the employ of Quinn, leaving her to begin her life as a couple with her longtime protector, Nick.  And trying to give himself the time to heal.  Giving her up was the hardest thing he had ever done since he&#8217;d been in love with her for a very long time.  He is now working as a bartender in a dive bar, having cut himself off from the Society and from Nick and Quinn.Riley Kordek has no where else to go, no one to turn to.  When she turned 21, strange things started happening to her.  She began to have abilities she never knew were possible.  Her mother and grandmother had never told her about the possibility of her being a Goddess.  She had to figure it out all alone.  But as she grew comfortable with it, she realized she drew her power from metal.  But she still had no idea of what she was capable of.  She started doing research and found the Society and watched training videos of Sam when he had been involved with them.  Then, other things started happening.  Rent payments disappearing before they made it to the landlord&#8217;s account.  She got fired from her job, evicted from her apartment.  She sensed she was being followed.  Her car was even stolen.  So she found Sam.  She needed answers.The night Riley walked into Sam&#8217;s bar, both their lives were changed.  Sam vowed to take her to the Society so she can get some help.  But then Nick calls and Quinn needs him.  She&#8217;s sick and they need Sam.  This book happens over the span of one week.  Riley and Sam find out that together, they are stronger.  And that they need each other to fight against the evils that want the powers the goddesses have.  Ansel is back and he hasn&#8217;t given up yet.  He wants power and has a new plan.  In both book one and book two, Natalie has the ability to keep us on the edge of our seats, and peaking with heart stopping action packed endings.  At the same time, building the romance between the main characters.  Sam and Riley needed each other, they just didn&#8217;t realize it.  And when they both finally accept it, it was a beautiful moment.&#8220;His illness hadn&#8217;t been because he wasn&#8217;t close enough to the ocean.  It was because he wasn&#8217;t close enough to her.  His body knew her, knew she was near, and thirsted for what she could give him.  Which terrified him.&#8221;I absolutely loved this book.  I loved that we had our new main characters but that the characters from the first book were also present for a smooth continuation of the story.

Keva Lane is a channel at the Institute of Parapsychology, a safe place for &#8220;enhanced human&#8217;s&#8221; to go and seek help or refuge. When she responds to an emergency call to help Sebastian Brooks, a psychic going supernova, things go horribly awry. Normal treatment methods don&#8217;t work, and Sebastian rudely suggests that she could cure him with sex. With lives at risk, Keva doesn&#8217;t have any choice but to give in to the sexy psychic. Little did she know that she would be setting off a chain of events that would change her life forever.The goodMrs. King always comes up with unique storylines and jaw dropping alpha men. She does not disappoint with this book, Bastien is HOT! Bastien is Sebastien&#8217;s alter ego, the Mr. Hyde of the two; demanding and plundering his way into Keva&#8217;s heart. Sebastien is the Dr. Jekyll, the level headed gentleman that know&#8217;s he&#8217;s no good for the kind hearted Keva. They both want her, both are out of control, and both can&#8217;t seem to keep it together long enough to stay or stay away.Girl, Mrs. King does the alpha male right. Is he arrogant, yes! What else would you expect from a no hold bars male that tells you what he wants and knows how to fulfill his promises?The badI really liked this book while I was reading until I made it to the end, then I felt underwhelmed. Like, cyberstalking a dress, ordering, then receiving and ripping open the package to find out that it doesn&#8217;t fit or is made from lame and makes you look like a giant disco ball; yes, I speak from experience. Here I was expecting a big showdown between Bastien and Sebastien; it was foreshadowed and the man could control the weather, so I thought it could be apocolyptic. And then there was the big bad institute doing wrong by the mutant&#8217;s, our heroes were not involved in their comeuppance. In fact, there was barely any conflict at all for the couple.

"This isn't exactly my favorite type of book. I like mysteries, but not international thrillers, which I typically find ridiculous. This leaned toward the international thriller genre, but I still found it interesting. The beginning--in Afghanistan--was boring and nearly made me stop reading. But when we got to Colorado and Sheriff Wolf, it got much better. The only problem I had was believability with some of the stuff involving our female FBI agent. Seriously, Wolf follows her, chasing and tailgating her without her knowing who's doing that, and doesn't expect to get shot at? Dumb. Still, i found the story interesting and worth reading.",4.0

"Jonathon Nichols is an Australian businessman who writes with considerable business insight about the very slow capitalist transformation of Myanmar. I&#8217;ve read another book of his, the non-fiction Puk Time Stories & Business Lessons on How to Make it Happen in Myanmar, which covered his own misadventures while seeing Myanmar as a grand opportunity in a brand new market, which was an interesting eye opening on a country that had been closed to the West for so long. In My My Myanmar, Nichols writes a fictional tale of two very different Westerners, the Hare and the Tortoise, who team up to try and make money off real estate deals. Here the business dealings are as interesting and sometimes hair raising in the non-fiction Puk Time, but Nichols writing in an almost allegorical way, according his characters (such as the Hare and the Tortoise) symbolic names, which I found a little unsettling, particularly the names given to the Myanmarese. By reading about people as symbols, rather than individuals, I found myself a little dislocated from the novel. Still, Myanmar and its labyrinthine systems is a fascinating place, and I can see why Nichols is drawn to writing about it, but I do wonder if his style isn&#8217;t more suited to non-fiction. Regardless, his bouncy, fast moving narrative is very appealing, and anyone interested in living and working in Myanmar (rather than touristing) will find this a useful read.",3.0

"I was so very intrigued by this story line. It was a very interesting on a common argument I here from people in their bitterness.  ( ""Only ____ have kids""  ""Why do we let _______ have more babies"" etc.) .  Clearly this book takes those rumblings to an extreme, but in this future world it works.  I will say that this particular installment does have a lot of world building and a lot of characters so it took me a bit to get myself completely immersed.  I blame most of that on my preggo brain.  Funny given the premise ;) . Once I got into the story, I was completely hooked.  It explores love on many levels and in a way I had not seen in NA before.  Watching the dynamics of all of the couples and family members was fascinating.  I was sad to see the story end and am very much looking forward to the next installment.  I am excited to see where the political pieces of this intricate story go.  I have a feeling the next book is going to blow me a way.  Do not let the warning scare you away.  While there are some hot scenes between a couple of the loving couples, this book really is not about that.  It truly is about love, in all forms.I would give this a 3.5 if it were a choice.I was given a copy of this book.",3.0
"*ARC provided by Netgalley*Brief Summary:Penny Black has been on the streets most of her life and she was fine with that. When she wakes up in an juvenile detention its pretty normal but when two men step up as her long lost &#8220;uncles&#8221; she is thrust into their lives where they tell her that she has the power to rewind time and try and prevent disasters.Wyatt Adams is put on duty to be Penny&#8217;s Lookout, he is excited and intrigued by Penny but will do anything to prove that he can be just as good as his older siblings at his job. To everyone Penny is a huge deal because she has powers that surpass everyone and that only makes it more difficult to prove people of his abilities.My Take on the Book:So &#8230; Apparently there was a series before this one? Well obviously that train sailed.However I would recommend that you read the Zellie Wells trilogy before you read this one, considering this series is a companion series, because I bet it will make so much more sense to you than it would if you started off with this series. I&#8217;ll admit I was a bit confused for the first few chapters but it was all good after that, the author did a pretty good job at keeping the reader up to pace with the storyline before this one.Even if it was understanding I still was confused towards the end with the powers and I don&#8217;t know what else I&#8217;ll probably be reading the Zellie Wells series soon and then re read this book.I enjoyed the author&#8217;s storyline with the whole rewinding time and the ones who have powers have triggers and just all of it! It was a whole different genre kind of read than the books I usually read and I liked it a lot and wouldn&#8217;t mind reading from something of that again. What was cool was that it was based in the future and there was this scene where someone was talking on their iPhone 23? Pretty legit.The Characters:Penny Black: So Penny was that girl who really didn&#8217;t give a crap about anything and went with the flow. I liked that she was a little different from the other normal heroines in the regular YA books such as --1) She is not &#8216;unattractive&#8217; as the girls think they are2) She has piercing3) She wears &#8216;goth&#8217; clothing4) She is NOT a virgin and doesn&#8217;t care.Did I mention she was very badass? Yup.Wyatt Adams: Wyatt was a very good Lookout for Penny and had everything in his best interests for her plus *cough* *cough* other things &#8230; *laugh nervously*I really liked Wyatt, he was a strong character that tried to do anything to keep Penny safe and to let the elders know that he can and will do his job. He is very smart and even though he isn&#8217;t gifted like the others he is still just as talented and he can keep up despite what others say.I also liked the fact about how he tried to keep his distance from Penny, well the way both of them tried to fight the attraction, it was rather cute in a way. He was just too sweet and kind, its not everyday you get a guy like Wyatt Adams(:Me Ranting:So this book was supposed to be a New Adult book and from what I have heard about NA is that they are mainly meant for the older teens and early 20 year olds because it involves more language and sex than YA but it really wasn&#8217;t. It was more Sci-Fi than NA which is perfectly fine but I don&#8217;t think they should have labeled it NA. There was sex towards the end but nothing got down to hot and heavy.An odd thing I had found while reading is the way the people talk and yes I know its set in the future but it sounds a bit kid to me I guess.Such as the words &#8216;buttwrinkle&#8217;  and &#8216;dicknob&#8217;  -- they felt a bit childish and weird but hey I guess that&#8217;s gonna be us soon. Also the characters used the words &#8216;bueno&#8217; and &#8216;chido&#8217; which I automatically knew as Spanish but they used it so many times that I had gotten confused about what they mean.&#8216;Bueno&#8217;  is used at good which is also its English translation and also can be used as &#8216;ok&#8217; or hello and so on. &#8216;Chido&#8217;  was the one that had me re reading the passages and trying to figure out what it meant and it took me quite awhile &#8230; It is basically slang for cool or alright like if someone says &#8216;She&#8217;s chido,&#8217; it means she&#8217;s cool or she&#8217;s alright. Get it?I&#8217;m probably going to continue the rest of the series because honestly at the end it became really confusing (to me anyways) and I&#8217;m hoping to have it all figured out later in the series!Overall I like the book and the character&#8217;s. Soon when the second book comes out, hopefully I will have money to buy it and solve all my weird questions like &#8230;THE ENDING?! How in the hell did she and up with him? I was beyond pissed off and I seriously cannot wait til the second because I NEED to know what happened and I think I will scream loudly to the heavens until I do!!!Rant over and out.Thanks for reading and happy reading!I am open for book recommendations and reviews.- Alyssia",3.0
"The story is great and captured my attention. It could definitely use some tightening up and some good editing and formatting though. I was easily distracted by missing words, punctuation, and so many information dumps that didn't quite fit in spots of the storyline and were unnecessary. This could be a top seller with a little help :) The twists in it kept me reading until the very end.",4.0
"Not my normal kind of book I would choose but I was given this book as a ARC - I was hooked and read it in two hours. No supernatural just pure romance with a little action thrown in.....Josie and Sam seem to be doomed at the start....treasure, mob ties & danger cause major roadblocks right off the bat to deter their relationship but they find...um (creative ways should I say?) to overcome them. :)Off to put the first two books on my to-read list....curious about the rest of the Layton boys and if they can hold a candle to Sexy Sam. What can I say? I'm a sucker for hot, nerdy guys with OCD.I actually liked a ROMANCE book. Go figure....LOLI was given this book as an ARC to facilitate my review, thoughts and opinions are my own.",5.0

"Not happy at all. We had been waiting outside while it's cold and raining for about 10 minutes when A group of ""regular customers""  walk up and go get​ a table before everyone else that was waiting. Those ""regulars"" were out side bragging about how they didn't have to wait like everyone else. Forget the fact that I'm pregnant, I have two children with me. There were four groups of other people ahead of them. The young guy who calls people in lied to our faces when I asked why they were seated before the one that had been waiting for awhile. I physically saw them pull up in there vehicle and walk up. So I know for a fact they were not here before us. Thanks to them not only my family but other families with very small children had to wait an extra ten minutes. This will be our first and last time here. I do not recommend coming here if everyone it's treated fairly. Very poor customer service!!!!",1.0
"I read the whole first part of the series and thought the story was original and held within plausibility.  I really liked it. But, in the first part of the book two I think the author stretched the &#34;Oh come on&#34; factor to the breaking point.  Our hero &#34;Cain&#34; blackmails a race of people to install a highly sophisticated and secret device into himself so that he would have more power, promising faithfully to keep the fact a secret. And, the reason he did it was to have it, not for some altruistic reason. Of course it turned out in the story that it's good thing he did.  But, like a little boy with a secret he really can't wait to share it with his girl friend. He's virtually telegraphing &#34;I've got a secret&#34; to her. With just the slightest urging he has to demonstrate his new power. He has shown that he really has no honor, no more than the bad guys he's fighting.Then we have the big fight between himself the &#34;bad&#34; earthling, which he wins by use of the new power. Of course the bad guy has now developed the secret of the new device and because, with the sketchiest of information, been able to develop the device in a matter of months. Not so sophisticated as all that apparently. Letting this man live could potentially set of a war between two races if he reveals the secret of the &#34;Speakers&#34; power.  And, he will.  He wants that war. He has personally killed some of Cains own men and  tried to kill him several times. So why did our hero let him live?  Good question. Cain has no moral stance against killing, in fact he's very good at it.The book ends with this criminal, who is complicit in the deaths of billions of humans, the abduction of humans for the Klin before that, and is wanted for various other crimes being transported back to Earth to stand trail in a luxury suite in a star ship with only two humans aboard. This criminal is a highly trained and deadly assassin, able to kill almost any human, let alone aliens with his bare hands. The Captain of the star ship is easily coerced into letting him go free, for the promise of great rewards in fame and fortune.In any plausible scenario this man would have been transported in the manner of Hannibal Lector, with a large guard detail of armed men watching him all times. Nobody would be allowed to be the same cell with him alone at any time.Of course the author wanted him free so that he can wreck havoc with the the federation and, of course, with Cain, in future books. But, I think a much better plot line should have been developed more in keeping with what might have happened in the real world of the novels universe.This is far from the authors better attempts.It looks to me like the author just got lazy.",3.0

"Angels is a compelling murder mystery that's far from Kipling's first, but among his best. A car accident opens the action, but what unfolds thereafter escalates the mystery and ups the ante quickly.Kipling weaves a satisfying world of crime, drama, murder victims and conflicted cops time and time again, and I'm not ashamed to say I keep coming back for more. His well-constructed plots reveal just enough to keep the reader guessing. This book in particular would be well-suited to a big screen adaptation.",5.0

"Where has this little gem been hiding, this really is an excellent book from Ernie Zelinski, more people should be aware of it. I especially like the line at the start of the book: ""You can disappear into the mainstream, or you can be true to yourself and swim against the current"". This sets the tone early on for what becomes an adventure of self-discovery. It is a compulsive and inspirational read, and you won't read it only once, you will refer back to its wisdom time and again.",5.0
"In many cases, the directions for the recipes are quite imprecise. I found this annoying until I came to the end of the book, where there is a comprehensive listing of the temperatures and times required for cooking various types of food. It is still a bit inconvenient to have to skip back and forth from the recipes to the listing of cooking times, but it is better than not having the times at all, especially for recipes which include raw meat. The author's rather shaky use of the English language does not inspire great confidence. Sometimes one has to guess what is meant. I am a bit put out by the author's instructions to start a fire with lighter fluid, but perhaps this is just a personal prejudice on my part. I would have preferred to see instructions on fire-starting that did not include lighter fluid, but maybe that's just me.",3.0
"Spoiler Alert....I am in the minority, so far, but I read all of the Winemaker's Series.  I loved the others, (and anxiously waited for this final installment); but this one...not so much.  I'm glad the ending was what it was, but the ""freak"" thing was too much!  I understood the premise of that angle, but I really grew bored of talking about his $#@& as if it was a seperate character of this book!  It took this series from a beautiful, gut-wrenching love story, to a goofy, cartoon-like mess.  Sorry Doc Ivan, I really did enjoy the Series, overall, but am disappointed with the approach of this last book.",3.0

this is one of her best book. i loved the hero and the heroine. they both have issues and they worked on it instead of hurting each other badly. they loved each other and it showed that looks do not matter. this is a good read. both of them were prideful people. the hero did not think the heroine was beautiful. at the end it did not matter. he loved his wife.,5.0

"I really liked this story.  It has everything a sci-fi reader wants.  The Earth gets waxed at the start (is that a spoiler?), but we teach them aliens a thing or two about killing humans.  This involves the military right away, some advanced weapons, and a lot of fighting other aliens.  A real good mix of two story lines that continue along in a logical sort of way.  The time involved in some of the actions by the Earth survivors is a little confusing.  Also, the surviving humans seem to have a wealth of resources that just need to be used to get us back into the fight.The story seems very plausible althought there are some questions about why the original attacking aliens didn't completely wipe out all humanity.  I don't buy the line that sympathetic aliens prevented the master aliens  from finding all the humans on the moon, in an orbiting space station and in the asteroid belt.  I mean with the advanced tech the Kleese seem to have, it should have been very easy to find and kill every single human in our galaxy!  But, they didn't and so we get to wipe them away, someday.I really hope this does become a series.  It has a great start but I think the author could go a little more in depth In the fighting and the reasoning and thoughts of the Kleese.Good military sci-fi.  Read it, you'll like it.",5.0
"Ella Jade has done it again.  I have yet to read a bad story by Ms. Jade.  I loved the premise of this story a lot.  Spencer Cannon has a problem.  He needs a date to accompany him to his cousin&#8217;s big wedding.  He needs to ward off his ex-girlfriend, Ava, who seems to be planning a reunion that Spencer does not want to happen.  So what does a guy do?  He finds and pays for a date.  Spencer is a man who does not spend enough time relaxing, work consumes most of his time.  Spencer is a nice guy who tries not to be rude or mean to those around him.Dakota Vercelli graduated from college and like many new college grad&#8217;s she can&#8217;t find a job.  Therefore, she works two jobs, one as a waitress, and the other as a cleaning lady.  Her mother is also sick so she helps her out financially as well.  Dakota takes Spencer up on his offer.  The problem is Dakota starts to fall for Spencer so she tries to get Spencer to fall in love with her.The chemistry between Dakota and Spencer is sizzling hot.  The have a lot of common interests even though they are from different worlds.  Spencer did not flaunt his wealth in Dakota&#8217;s face or anyone&#8217;s.  He had that quite grace that comes from someone who grew up with money and know better than the flaunt it.  The sex scenes were hot.  Dakota&#8217;s and Spencer&#8217;s emotions were apparent even though they did not talk about it until much later in the story.I loved the supporting characters; they added spice to the story.  While I found Ava pathetic, I wonder what motivates her?  I wonder if we will see more of these characters in the future?  I hope so!  Overall, I loved the story and read it in one sitting.",5.0
"All that can be said about this great book needs to take a moment because what resonates with me so permanently is this real and personal view of India that I haven't experienced before in any book. I'd like to tell Mr. Kusy well done for this fact alone. I'd also like to meet his Mom, because I love her.I'd really like to hate Spud and his love of treachery and women, but he's endearing in the way that our most flawed friend is. We know they're insane, but we keep them around anyway. Rose and Ram and Nick and Anna are such great additions to the posse and I loved reading about them and their experiences.This book is a memoir that will make you laugh and cry and feel like you've made friends. You'll fall in love with India and even a little bit with London. A lot of reviews of books say that you will laugh and cry but this book is so genuine and brings you with it that you can't help but experience it and feel all the emotion.If you have wanderlust or know someone who does, this will be the fix you need. Read it, love it, pass it around.Maybe Spud just needs a hug.",5.0
"I was really excited to hear that Vic and Laura would have their own short story. I fell completely in love with Vic the minute he appeared in Because of You.

He just couldn&#8217;t show it.  I love that the author shows both his and her point of views. How they each dealt with the separation and Vic&#8217;s injury. The man dress was too much. Loved it!

"Loved the storyline. Excellent character development for main characters, although lacking for secondary characters. Needs better editing, and some of the spelling/word choices were wrong (You don't get an award called an accommodation, you get a commendation). With editing, this would have easily been a 5. Note: there has been mention of the MMMM interaction-- it was well done, but seemed a bit gratuitous/unnecessary. I don't think it added anything to the storyline, but it didn't turn things horribly wrong either... it just didn't make a whole lot of sense to add it in.",4.0
"I absolutely love this series!!!!Ok so let me start with, you do not have to read the first two to understand and enjoy Sweet Forty- Two. However, there are characters a parts of the story line that come from the first two.It's no secret I fell in love with book #1 Ten Days of Perfect. This was Andrea Randall's first book. It was good&#8230; really good. Well, with each book Randall gives us a bit more of who she is as a writer. She shows a little more heart and a little more of what goes on up in that head of hers.So fast forward to me reading Sweet 42. There was no way i wouldn't like it. I just knew. What I wasn't prepared for is the direction Andrea Randall took this story. She pulled out all the stops and stripped herself bare as a writer. This sort of thing doesn't happen in serial books. I mean we are talking this is worth reading as a stand alone. It is that good. Randall carefully scratches at the exterior of your heart so as not to damage it but enough to make you feel the characters angst and their struggles.Georgia, the female m/c is quirky and animated-- to mask her deep rooted fear of becoming something unknown. I love her edge and carefully constructed persona. But the sweetness of her true generosity and selflessness subtly plays in your peripheral visual. Enough to grab you attention and make you want to find out more about her.Regan. Oh sweet Regan. He is casually and carefree sexy. You want to hold your hand out to him, to reassure him. He's strong and manly enough not to hide his vulnerability. But broken enough to be cautious and unsure of his actions.I have to mention Amanda, Georgia's mom, her part in the story while small in appearing in the actual plot of the story, she was monumental. Her clarity amongst the unknown (I don't want to spoil what that is) actually fuelled Georgia and Regan's relationship. She was an unexpected hero-- an amazing hero. Her confident resolve was proof that the stigmas and negativity surrounding mental health and mental wellness need to evolve and need more understanding.Throughout the story, i couldn't get it out of my head that although the mental illness that Amanda lived with wasn't the surrounding point of the story, it could to be denied its presence. It melded the story together. It also was a significant reminder that everyone has a bit of 'nonsense' in their life. We all face the unknown. We all face the possibility of not knowing who we will be tomorrow or how we will live tomorrow. The whisper of mental illness in Sweet 42 screamed endless possibilities, second chances, understanding and living life with your heart to keep your mind open.Sweet 42 is a must read for its beauty. Andrea Randall will make your heart sing, embrace nonsense and fall in love with life.",5.0
"I did enjoy how the author chose the women protagonist as a strong women who had some vulnerabilities. This made her of a more realistic character yet the story itself I believe needed more.

"Although there are some erotic moments in this story, this story was much sweeter, romantic, and character-driven than the erotic story that I was expecting.  Bell has excelled in creating an inspirational story of first love in multiple dimensions -- two side characters who are reconnecting after the premature end of their relationship, two side characters who never give up home in their search for love, the cynical young man who isn't sure if he believes in love, and the romantic who hasn't yet experienced it.

"Mira and Erik are happy. Or at least that&#8217;s what Erik thought. But one day he finds Mira gone. Just like that. No explanation, no note, nothing. She has simply vanished from his life. After thirteen months Erik manages to track her down. But something has changed. The Mira he used to know is no more. She has a secret and she has hidden it from Erik for a reason.Erik weasels his way into Mira&#8217;s life again and slowly, layer by layer, they will figure out what is really going on around them.This story was quite gripping from the start. Surprising and full of twists and turns that kept me turning the page after page. The characters were awesome, especially Erik. Sure, he is a douche. And some of his macho moves made me wanna scream. The more I read the less I liked him. That said, in my opinion if a story awakes this many emotional reactions as this one did, it has filled its purpose.The author has definitely created an interesting story line and developed the characters well, so add a hint of old legend to it and voila, the reader is sold.Excellent job!",5.0

To start with, not having a table of contents made it hard for me to navigate the content. It also meant I didn't have any idea what to expect. After all, it's not like a physical book where it's easy to flick through - it takes time to scroll through each page. There were also some strange dashes and formatting issues. Look, I seriously thought about giving it a lower rating, but I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and try and persist despite the fact that it's not easy to read.

It makes me realise that the author is just milking me for every cent they can because they think I'm enjoying the series and will potentially keep buying books into perpetuity as long as they don't resolve the story....Perhaps I'm being too harsh but it leaves really a bitter taste for me when I've read book 7.5 (at least the author had the decency to be too embarrassed to call it book 8 in an unresolved plot) and now have to wait for the author to finish writing the next book.  It tells me she's going to keep stringing me along as much as she possibly can.  If she had resolved it in a standalone trilogy and then released another standalone trilogy with the same characters at a different place in their lives I would feel less exploited and far more inclined to support the author's future work.As it is I can say with absolute certainty that Addison Moore will not see another cent from me.  Heck in some of the books in this series virtually nothing even happened!  I was clearly caught in a trap for beginners by this author but rest assured, it won't happen again.  Not only will Addison  Moore not see another cent from me but in future I will always be weary of buying series of books anything other than standalone trilogies from ANY author.  Now that I have learnt that there are some authors here on Amazon who are just out to &#34;stick it&#34; to their readers I will be far more weary even if they get good ratings.  Addison Moore gets one star for teaching me a valuable lesson.",1.0

"In this cute, short story you will find two madly in love men, Ronin & Maverick.  It is the kind of love that all dream of for themselves.  Soul mates.  We get to sneak a peek at their discovery of each other and we get to watch the adorable scene that brought them together. We get a point of view from both of them and it is so amazing to feel the emotion from both sides. We also get to watch Ronin and Mav their rediscovery of each other.  When tragedy hits this strong love where will Ronin go with himself?  Will Mav be able to get passed the block that helps him get to where he should be?I immediately took a liking to this story from page one.  Author Sandrine Gasq-Dion starts with emotions that pull at your heart strings and brings you into the character and makes you feel sadness and loss right along with him.  She delicately continues to play with your heart strings as we continue on this short journey of two soul mates.  I love the charm she filled the pages with and the support of the families. I also adore when an author can write something this short and make it feel complete. Job well done Sandrine! I hope there are more works as I'm very interested now in your writing! If you like true love romances with a little spin on the spiritual world making an appearance to fix a mistake then this book is just right for you! I give this book my thumbs up!",4.0
"Doubles is your usual abducted cheerleader type, chained up in a basement with a torturer driven by a hate for his own mother torturing and assaulting her for his own sick reasons novel. However it reads like a movie that is deliberately leaving stuff up to its audience's imagination rather than having you experience those events through the victim's eyes so it can get a PG rating.  We've also got a quarterback strung up down in the basement who really seems to have no real purpose other than to communicate with Cameron in between her being dragged upstairs so we know what happened and provide some back story on how evil, the abductor has been so far to previous girls.Doubles is certainly no William Malmborg'sJimmy, or J.F. Gonzalez'sSurvivorand those type of books where you actually experience what the victim does and really live their fear as the torture happens to them through experiencing each scene along with them.  The other main problem with this one is that it is told as a flashback, so we know Cameron obviously survives and she also reminds us it is a flashback a few times.  Part of the thrill of better thrillers is not knowing if the person telling the story will survive, escape, whatever.  Simonson should have told this as a real time reading experience, especially for Cameron's point of view.  We still could have had read some of it through the abductor's eyes, other victims, twin sister and FBI agent too.  But flashback style doesn't work with this one, the only reason to use this style is if your going to graphically remember the scenes but since each scene just ends with something like being taken up stairs, then waking up later or being chained back up, there's no payoff for using that style.Cameron was an interesting and likeable character and one the reader will certainly root for to survive, which is what you need with this genre.  The villain was a bit underdeveloped and even though he keeps telling you he's really intelligent, it's obvious he's not.  The FBI agent was a bit too arrogant and constantly telling the reader he is better than your average person at observing things and other life aspects to enjoy reading through his eyes.",3.0

"Caleb is a made prophet that would prefer fighting than making peace. He has never forgotten Lily who many years ago left him, to married someone else for duty. Caleb has waited many years, but now that Lily is on the market looking for passion again. He decides that he wasted enough time already, and that he is going to go after what he wants.Caleb is one of those sexy heroes to die for.Lily is a strong woman, who has finally decided that is her time to shine.This was a fast paced novel that kept me reading page after page. There was love, but also plenty of action as well as paranormal elements. Once again, Rebecca Zanetti proves why she is a NY and USA best seller. I don&#8217;t know how she does but she can create tales that are full of passion and mysteries to be remembered by her readers for many years to come.The ending was unexpected that left me with my mouth open.I highly recommend this novel, another winner, not to be missed.

"4.5 Stars!This is the second book in the White Sandy series and is a wonderful addition. I thoroughly enjoy reading about these sexy men and the women that tame them.Mary Beth is moving to a new place and a new life, taking a job as a local veterinarian near the reservation of White Sandy. She is leaving her current boyfriend, but then that is not unusual as she is following the same pattern of leaving as she has with the last five men. She never wants to lose control of her life so before she gets too involved she leaves.Jacob, a Lakota Indian who works at a nearby ranch wears a leather mask to hide his face. For the last three years his whole purpose in life is to hide and protect Kip, a seven year old albino child who watched her parents die and Jacob get injured. Many believe she is a holy person and will protect her with their lives as they feel she is still in danger.Buck McGillis, the owner of the ranch where Jacob works and who is Mary Beth's largest customer, is an evil man who Mary Beth ends up pissing off right away, I love that she is so outspoken, again to keep control in her life but she uses the snarky personally with ease.As summer gives way to fall, things heat up between Mary Beth and Jacob, and it is fun watching them move toward each other, and then back off just as fast. Yet no matter how they feel, there is one thing that they both agree on, they are baffled by several mysterious happenings around the area; Jacob's mustangs get sick and the slaughter of cattle near the reservation. And then to make things more complicated, everyone is in danger when Kip disappears, yet Jacob knows just where she is.I am so happy to return to White Sandy, the characters are so interesting and intriguing. This is the second book in the series and although we do revisit a story line from the first book of a mysterious poisoning and meet some of the same people, this can easily be read alone, but why would you want to as the first book is so good. The story starts slow as both Mary Beth and Jacob fall into a routine of work and watching each other from afar, yet it definitely picks up after one steamy afternoon during a storm, and as they deal with the aftermath, the emotions run deep.I love Jacob; he is so protective of those around him, Kip especially. Yet when he meets Mary Beth he immediately brings her into this protective shelter he has created. Even when he tries to stay away, he is always watching out for her. The chemistry between Jacob and Mary Beth sizzles and I love when she can't stay away even when she is mad. She is so outspoken that you never have to wonder what she thinks or feels and tells Jacob frequently.I enjoy seeing characters we have met before help Jacob and Mary Beth find answers to problems plaguing them, I especially enjoy seeing Nobody and hope to hear his story one day, and of course I am happy to see Madeline and Rebel anytime.The story catches you from the start as Ms. Anderson weaves a tale of mystery and Indian lore that surrounds the reservation. I am excited to see where this story is going; I love the White Sandy area and those that live there.Copy provided by author for an honest review",5.0

When I read his first book Killing Matt Cooper I was a bit unsure at first, but by the end I was floored. After finishing book two I am speechless absolutely speechless. This is an amazing book and Mr. Cassian is a gifted author. I look forward to reading more of his works.""Evolution was trying to stamp me out because I liked to swim in the black pool of my own darkness.""An FBI agent in love with the serial killer she is assigned to capture, it's almost laughable but John Cassian makes it believable.

You seemed like such a normal guy, such a hard-working, misunderstood everyman, but with this...dark underbelly.""

"Never in a million years did I expect the ingenuity of Pulp Friction 2013. Four authors and a total of twenty books: Lee Brazil (Chances Are), Havan Fellows (Wicked's Way), Laura Harner (Triple Threat) and T.A. Webb (City Knight). 'Odd Man Out' is the culmination of all of these intertwined story lines and brings an end to these books. *sob* I can always re-read, thank goodness, for these books are all simply incredible.WOW. WOW. WOW. This was some story. I am, and forever will be, your friend.....oh, just kidding *snort*, I meant I forever will be in love with Wicked Quantavious Templeton. Havan, you're my personal goddess for having written him. The fact he got his butt chewed a lot throughout this story was just what he needed, especially by Archer. However, a huge portion of this story was about family and love and forgiveness, and watching Wick and the boys get their crap straightened out was wonderful.It was tough watching the one member of their team get taken and held, but I knew he was up to the task of figuring out who took him, why and how to use it against the jerk! It was hardest watching the brothers and their spouses trying so hard to be strong and look at every angle to figure out the who.Loved, loved, loved this finale! It was such a surprise to discover who the serial killer was - way to go guys on making it super intriguing. The very best part, though? The Christmas Eve get together and gift exchange. Beautiful. Thank you SO MUCH to Lee, Havan, Laura and Tom - y'all are the greatest. You write wonderful characters, you merge them all together seamlessly, and you write kick butt sex scenes.

There was a lot of character development in the beginning of the book, and it lead up to an amazing plot with many twists and turns, and an unexpected ending.The Fall is a beautiful love story about a girl (Ivy) who doesn't think she deserves a real relationship. She unexpectedly falls in love with Ryder Sutton, who sweeps her off her feet. There is one problem though, Nix believes Ivy belongs to him. Ryder is protective and caring, Ivy is scared, and Nix is confident and controlling. If you throw in a Mother who seemingly doesn't care you have a recipe for disaster.I absolutely fell in love with Ivy. She is strong, beautiful and brave. I also fell in love with Ivy and Ryder's love. They are perfect together. I will anxiously await the release of The Heart.",5.0
"Jama has agreed to watch her brother's dog, Duke, while he and his wife, Keely (fromThe Good Luck Charm (The Good Luck Series), which I have not read) enjoy their honeymoon. Before she takes on her first day of pet-sitting she's visited by a family friend named Lucinda who gives her a good luck charm that she insists will point her towards her soul-mate. Jama isn't superstitious, but takes and wears the charm anyway. Since Jama has zero experience with dogs, she overreacts when she thinks Duke might be sick and calls Duke's vet, the adorable Kyle Landers. When the charm starts acting strange, will Jama be able to let go of her past relationship and give Kyle a fighting chance?This is adorable, it's very sweet and there are no ""misunderstandings"" or ""problems"" that are commonly associated with romance novels. This is just easy, simple, non-convoluted reading. It's not perfect by any means, but sometimes a simple read is just a relief. It is predictable, and it is wrapped up (read: rushed) much too quickly at the end, but it's also endearing with characters that I found likable and pleasant. I'd recommend this for a nice, relaxing afternoon read.*This is a clean romance, just kissing...no naughty bits.",4.0
{my thoughts} - This book takes place seven years after the first. It is mainly focused around them walling themselves off from the rest of the world. They are doing this as an attempt to save those within their small community. The majority of the book is about Hannah and Justin's wedding. They decide to get married since they already knew that they were predestined to be together based on Hannah's visions. This way they can distract the individuals within their community from worrying about what they are about to be going through with and from being sick with fear over the entire ordeal. The distraction plays a key role up until the last chapter in which the pandemic officially begins. Hannah's visions become more real to their community then they had ever been before.{reason for reading} - I had read the first book and fallen in love with the story line.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.,5.0

"I love bright colors on my kindle cases.  My Kindles generally stay in the last case they were in until the next great case comes along.  The color on these cases actually has me changing them between the cyan and the purple pretty regularly.This Hive case is flexible enough to get on the Kindle Fire easily, but doesn&#8217;t feel loose in any way.  I like the texture to it, as well.  Having textures on the edges makes it easy to hold on to, and even to find when it is stuck someplace, like a dark, dark purse.Another nice part of this case is the rubberized edge.  It doesn&#8217;t slide very easily when you are in a moving vehicle.  The hard plastic is sort of indented so the rubberized edges catch what it is sitting on.This is a very nice case.  I would not put it on one of the children&#8217;s Kindle Fires though.  While I haven&#8217;t actually dropped it, it doesn&#8217;t feel like very strong protection.  I see that it says it is especially suited for the occasional accident but I would think the combination soft rubber and hard case would cause more trouble.  Live and learn.",4.0

"Well, I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed this book!  When I read the synopsis, I knew it was a hit or miss.  Either I wasn't going to be able to finish it or I was going to thoroughly enjoy it - there would be no middle.Naomi Grim is just that - she's a Grim (what we'd call a Grim Reaper).  Her job is simple - collect lifestones from humans after they die.  These lifestones are not only worth money but add years onto her life.She's not a normal Grim however, she feels for the humans that die.  She asks questions that normal Grim's don't even care to think about let alone ask.When she's given a very important assignment, along with her brothers, best friend, and her brother she's both excited and nervous.They are to live among human teenagers in order to collect lifestones after a school bombing/shooting.Will she be able to stick to her roots and simply hang out in the background until it's time to collect or will her personality and heart intervene?There is so much to this story - it is so much more than Naomi's ability, or lack thereof, when it comes to her calling.  This is a story about familial obligations, sense of self, sense of community but more importantly, this is a story of not only finding out who you are but following through with what you know to be right.I am glad I read this when I did, I don't have to wait to start book 2!  I'll be starting on that one ASAP so I can find out what is in store for Nowhere!4 stars for this one!",4.0

Finding Jaclyn's killer is a complex process that requires creativity on the part of Logan and Jaclyn and the help of a photographer who can hear Jaclyn, Logan and other ghosts.I really enjoyed the way Ms. Vann approached her story. It was creative and new. Jaclyn's Ghost held my attention from the start and had me rooting for Jaclyn and Logan as they tried to discover what had happened to Jaclyn. Ms. Vann throws several interesting complications into the story line that keep the tension going.

This is one such time.I knew what the story was about when I downloaded it and I thought Alex was pretty enticing myself, for a night or two but no more. Based on everything I thought I knew about Carly she seemed to be a pretty together woman, which is why it is so surprising that she not only fell for, but willingly signed up for his crap, and crap is exactly what it was. It sounds as though I didn't like this story and really I didn't but that doesn't mean it isn't a story worth reading. Based on my disgust with both Carly and Alex I think its' safe to say that Emily Quinn did a good job writing them out. I'm sure she'd rather have me hate the characters rather than be indifferent.Like I said I knew how it'd end before I even began reading it, I just wish for the sake of women that Carly put up more than a cursory fight and put him in his place a little. But since that's not to be, I think there are plenty of people who will love this story.",3.0
"Another horror novella by DarkFuse. These books all have one thing in common: they're definitely quality work. Menace is no exception.Jane Marlow is a succesful model who, after a night of passion with a B-movie actor, finds herself pregnant with his child. She decides to make the most of it, and try to earn as much money as she can before she starts showing. When a mysterious modeling project lands in her mailbox, she doesn't hesitate. The project is for a book cover by a mystery and suspense author, and to complete it, she must travel to a remote house by the sea in northeast England.When Jane arrives at the house, she's immediately taken aback by its exterior, by the creepy vibe it gives off, and by the sullenness of the place. When she changes into her clothes for the photoshoot, and sees a bunch of children playing near the shore, she panicks at first, fearing for the kids' safety. But when she rushes downstairs, there's no one to be seen.After the shoot, she gets the proof of the cover in her mailbox, sent by the photographer, and to her surprise and horror, the kids show up in the background. She contacts the author, trying to figure out what's happening once and for all. But Jane has no idea what she signed up for when she accepted the job, and now something dark and menacing is growing inside her...This dark mystery with a ghostly tale woven in is a little disturbing, and a good read. The author manages to keep the atmosphere tense all the time. The ending was a tad bit dissapointing for me - the big reveal didn't seem like much of a reveal, and I found the entire explanation a bit lacking - but all in all, this was a very pleasant reading experience. What I perhaps enjoyed the most, are the atmosphere, and the subtleness of the horror.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.",4.0

"Gators is a staple in our band viewing and listening options. We recently visited and saw a new band called Flyte Band Tampa. They definitely made the night great. They played a fun mix of songs that you could dance to and did it well. We'd definitely come back to see them again. It's too bad that the food seems to be only fair. It used to be better but has been slipping on taste and quality as of late. I'm not saying it's bad but rather it has slipped to being simply ""bar fare"", perhaps it can rise again. We shall see.",3.0

"I did not read any reviews of this book. I bought it on the bases of the blurb and cover art alone. Not to mention the more than reasonable price. What a pleasingly  unpleasant  surprise. David Haynes can really write, and he transports the reader back to the Victorian era with its hypocrisy  and barely concealed underbelly of squalor and horror. A chilling little book. I agree with the reviews I've read since: 5 stars all the way and encore!",5.0
"I read this a little while ago and I'm glad I waited to review it. This way, most of my original dissatisfactions have fallen by the wayside. Instead I'm left with the basics: an interesting story line, an unusual main character and a well presented landscape. Even if the sex scenes could be improved on, I can not say I did not enjoy them. The dialogue was a hit and miss, but no so much to be jarring. The initial descriptions of the main character's charms were a bit of an overkill, but all in all I have to say I enjoyed it. It was a guilty pleasure.",3.0

"The cantonese-style BBQ pork (char siu) available from the front counter is criminally unknown/underrated. In terms of notable local meats, I would put this pork right there with, e.g., Pappy's ribs. And it's something like $8 a pound, which is insane. Put it in baguette sandwiches with some hoisin sauce and cilantro. Serve it over a bowl of rice or, even better, in fried rice with some egg and green onions. Grab hunks of it and insert them into your face. These are all strong moves.

Other things that are good, in descending order of importance: shrimp dumplings and pork buns and deep-fried pork balls from the bakery section, roast pork belly with crispy skin from the meat counter, the eggplant, chicken, and salted fish ""casserole"" (poor translation -- think clay pot dish), beef chow fun.",4.0
"My Thoughts - 4 out of 5 unicorns - I really liked it!**Received the ebook from Carina Press via Netgalley in exchange for an honest reviewFirst, yes the cover is awesome and isn't he just WOW and loving his tat :)Okay, I really liked this book and think it sets up this new world fabulously.  There were a few slow pieces, but I usually expect it in the first book in a series.  The author's writing style makes it easy to love the characters.  She also has a twist on dragons that I have never read before in their creation which is cool.  I think Myrna rocks because she is this five foot nothing woman who stands up to dragons what is not to love.  She is kind & caring, but will not be pushed around, and I love her integrity.  Then there is her ex-boyfriend Trian who brings all sorts of tension to the story.  There are all sorts of secrets, plots, drama, attacks, and so much more.  There are some things that I could see coming in this book, but there were also some things that came to light that I was holding my breath saying NO it can't be!!  I love when authors surprise even if I don't like the surprise (sigh), but you have to read it because I refuse to ruin this journey for you.  I can't wait for the next book to see what happens next, and I secretly hope that Myrna & Trian continue to be the main characters because I love them.I recommend this book to all my dragon lovers & paranormal fans because it was a great read, and you will enjoy it!",4.0
"While I did end up liking this book, it was a bit slow out of the gate.  This was a love triangle of sorts, so I understand there was some build up, maybe just a bit too much in certain areas and not enough in others.Quinn grew up with Jake and Luke McGrath, her and Luke were best friends from grade school through college, up until she fell in love Jake.  Now Luke doesn't know where he fits in with Quinn and his brother, so he doesn't even try to.Jake and Quinn decide to get married which brings Luke back into their lives full force.  Secrets are revealed and tragedy ensues.This review is hard to write as I do not want to spoil it for other readers.  Like I said, the book was good but a bit of a slow start.",4.0

"So...how do i update my review calmly? Well, as far as the food goes...it was really good (better than my previous experience). I ordered a pound of pork to go as well as a side of beans, but first I wanted to make sure they were gluten free. Everyone looked at each other like errrrr...??? Then someone shouted from the back of the kitchen (you can see straight through when you order) ""WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE BREAD IT IN."" Really? No sh!t smartass. Someone actually asked about them and i was finally told they were safe. Sorry to be such an inconvenience!  I may be back for the food, but that's twice now I've experienced not so great service.

"I picked this one up as a freebie about a year ago and I am trying to work through my short reads. I randomly decided to read this the other night. It was very quick but it had some heavy aspects. There is violence, rape, and kidnapping. There are vamps, druids, rogue vamps, pheromones, all kinds of stuff. I wouldn't read this if you can't deal with the dark elements. It's in the title so please avoid if that's not your cuppa.The GOOD: I like the world that is being built in this short read. You have the dying race of vamps whose females are becoming sterile, you have druid human females and males (I guess) that can mate with the vamps and produce the next generation. With that world in place, it brings the vamps to a level of desperation and animalism just cause well...what else do you do when facing extinction? That's right people. You freak the hell out.I also liked the semi-menage scene. It was pretty hot.The BAD: It was pretty short so you aren't given a lot to go off of. And you wonder why the heroine, under her circumstances, would be attracted to her captor. Almost like the lesser of two evils - cause there is a big bad vamp and his group that also want her and the hero isn't gentle but is gentler than the other options.The UGLY: I had a laugh out loud-are-you-serious- moment when I read a euphemism for how the author described a body part. It was hilarious in a I'm-laughing-at-you kind of way. Something about breasts looking like creamy flesh ballons. Really? REALLY??!! Okay if that's what you want to imagine... I mean I guess... Flesh balloons are weird. Please don't ever use that again. For the sake of my brain, I'm begging you.",3.0

"I'm  a sucker for anything Tudor. I surely wouldn't want to have LIVED in Tudor England but I enjoy the heck out of a book that opens a window on that time and place and let's me look my fill. The author has created a believable narrator in a young lady in waiting that is neither a bit of knight-dependent fluff OR a sword wielding fearless shield maiden that is such a fixture in much current fiction. Anne Boleyn (Ambition's Queen), whom the narrator serves, is also a believable interpretation. She is neither the wild eyed hellion of &#34;The Other Boleyn Girl&#34; nor the tragic flower of &#34;Anne of the Thousand Days&#34;. Just a good read. You already know how it ends...",4.0

"Mimi Barbour's ""Partners"" maybe a short suspense/romance as a prequel to ""Roll the Dice"" but it's fast-paced, funny--Aurora has an attitude that just won't quit--full of suspence and lots of action. Aurora, a Vegas cop, is determined to capture the brutal rapist who hurt her friend but butts her head with her new ""Mr. Macho"" partner (Kai Lawson) who is just as gung-ho to get the criminal for his own reasons. I would have liked to know the color of Kai's eyes and just how sexy he really is, but hey, you'll find that out in the next book as I did--and I was not disappointed. ""Partners"" offers you just a teeny taste of the on-going story and its two strong characters and will leave you ravenous for the next course in ""Roll the Dice"". You won't want to miss any of Ms. Barbour's Vegas series.",4.0

This amazing author has done it again! *applause* I feel like I'm the luckiest person alive when I've finished a real good book! Thanks to Author Ruthi Kight for making me feel lucky!The author has written perfectly balanced characters! I love that Delia is sassy and has a little spit fire mouth on her but at the same time she has a soft side and you can't help but fall in love! Sometimes I plain out laughed out loud! In all the seriousness of this book there was humor brought into it at just the right moments! Loved it! See I'm telling you perfectly balanced!Then we have Liam! Wowzees! Ummm...HAWT! There's a particular scene that will make the ladies squirm in their seats! Yummy! He's full of secrets just like Delia though and these two together is like fireworks exploding in your face! Seriously their attraction is amazing! I wanted to jump in a few times too! * wink wink* lol Those scenes were sensual and seductive! Well done!What will Delia have to do to settle her inner turmoil of what she's had to deal with? What will Liam do when he's faced with unearthed secrets? You don't want to miss the little mystery twist she's thrown in there too! Took me by surprise and gave me even more love for the author!

"When you read a title like this - it in no way prepares you for the thriller and mystery of this book. This was a proper page turner, full of intrigue, as the main character has what we assume is a mental breakdown (he can't remember and resorts to his notes) - so it's a voyage of discovery along with the main character.I thought this was brilliant, original, and damn ballsy.

"Make You Mine is the third book in the Rock God Series and the perfect title for Jayson and Coop&#8217;s story.  Jayson was introduced to us in the last book as Chase&#8217;s friend who questioned if Chase was homosexual.  After what appeared to be a judgment on his part, we learned that Jayson was gay but had never told anyone out of fear of rejection.At a party that Alex was giving, Cooper and Jayson connected and the sparks flew.  Knowing that Jayson was finally opening himself up to affection from another man was wonderful for me as I felt so sorry for him in the last book.  After the party Cooper went back home on the west coast while Jayson went back to his construction company on the east coast.  If this was going to work they would have to form a long distance relationship.We are taken on their journey of finding each other, making time for a weekend getaway, video chats so they could see each other, phone calls and texts.  Cooper had money and would get in trouble by trying to help Jayson. Jayson was a proud business owner, he wasn&#8217;t rich but he got by with what he earned on his own.  He didn&#8217;t want to be taken care of so when Cooper would reach out to help either with a problem Jayson was facing or to arrange for them to be together Jayson had a hard time accepting it for what it was.Once they decided that they did have a chance at a future it meant Jayson was going to have to come out and tell people and change his life.  Let&#8217;s just say some of his family didn&#8217;t make it easy for him but Cooper was determined to support Jayson through it.  When Jayson had to make a decision to go back to the east coast and try to help a family member, he had no clue what he was going to face in the midst of the family drama that his coming out caused.  Would all of the anger and hatred be too much for Jayson to continue his relationship with Cooper?  Sometimes fighting for what you want is harder than just accepting defeat and doing what others expect from you.What I love most about Ann&#8217;s books is she keeps her stories real.  We see the prejudices against homosexuals and the pain they endure not only from society but from their own family.  She doesn&#8217;t leave us in the darkness of prejudice, she shows us what love and acceptance can conquer with her characters.  In a way she displays the black and white attitudes of society, the good versus evil and gives the reader a chance to see the other side of the situation through characters that we begin to feel something for.  She tries to give courage to those who hide who they are, so they can take a risk and trust that they will find people who will accept them.  For the narrow minded she proves that you can show compassion and acceptance without risking your convictions. Allowing others to find their happiness doesn&#8217;t have to threaten what you have as a straight person. We could all learn about acceptance and love through the characters in the Rock God Series.  I admire what she gives in each of her stories and I highly recommend her Rock God Series to everyone.Reviewed for Crystal's Many Reviewers Blog",5.0
"From the moment you step into the cake bake shop you can tells its unlike any other bakery in Indy. Its decorations are very frilly and ornate in the most adorable sense! The cases are lined with treats that are as wonderful to look at as they are to eat. I got two eclairs and two cookies; after the friendly cashier rang up my total I was a bit taken back. This is definitely a special occasion/bad day kind of bakery. The treats are obviously made with a large amount of attention to detail but this place is definitely not pocketbook friendly!



Went to the Cake Bake Shop again today for a piece of coconut cream pie. Paid $9.80 for one piece of pie. I think the owner should reevaluate the amount of embellishments (gift bags, fancy napkins,pink forks) and the amount of staff members standing around to lower the costs. The pie was just ok.

"It was a wonderful circumstance when I ran into LD Davis&#8217; Accidentally On Purpose about a year or so ago while purchasing another book. Thank goodness for Amazon&#8217;s genius marketing strategy when they recommend similar books to their buyers that I was lead to the story of Emmy, Kyle, and Luke which became burrowed deeply into my psyche. Little did I know that the  moment Emmy uttered the words, &#8220;Kyle was my boss, and a dick&#8221; in Accidentally On Purpose that this entire series would drive me to become an AOP fanatic.If LD Davis was standing in front of me, I would do either one of two things- bow down and kiss her shoe clad feet for writing such a beautiful tortuous story of love&#8217;s complexities or grab hold of her shoulders and shake her silly as retribution to the many moments I&#8217;ve taken time out in my real life to internally curse her for how Worthy of Redemption ended. I&#8217;m going to admit it..  I, Melanie of We Like It Big Book Blog was a BIG, HUGE fan of Kyle Sterling. There was something so attractive about his character, that he truly became an unhealthy book boyfriend obsession for me. These inexplicable feelings for his character shows the immense writing talent of the author. As a reader, I had somehow become Emmy as each page of the book turned. So, as I had mentioned, I was left bereft and aching at the end of Worthy of Redemption because as any crazy fangirl, I felt that it should have ended the way I wanted it to end.. Selfish? Yep, maybe a little bit. :)When LD announced that she would be coming out with a novella for Luke, I reacted with a one shoulder shrug but couldn&#8217;t even lie to myself how interested I was to hear from the &#8220;good guy&#8217;s&#8221; point of view. You see, Luke&#8217;s character in both Accidentally On Purpose and Worthy of Redemption didn&#8217;t really do too much for me because I felt his character was so flat. He was the good guy, the guy all women would die crawling through the desert for just for the chance to end up in his bed and stay there forever. I was surprised with myself for feeling this way about the sweet, straight arrow hero because I was never the believer of the &#8220;nice guys finish last&#8221; mentality. I always fell for the nice guy. Another reason why AOP is so mystifying to me. How in the hell did LD take me out of my comfort zone? How did she so easily took me out of my element?  The only answer I can come up with is this- she&#8217;s got magical, unearthly powers.Worth The Fight is an impassioned novel and its pages bleed of anger and betrayal. When I refer to the author as having some sort of enchanting powers, what I really mean is that she is one of the few out there right now who has pure, raw talent for writing. I am perturbed as to how she was able to make Worth The Fight a whole new book when 90% of this novel is a re-telling of events that have already occurred but told in Luke&#8217;s point of view. There are too many sequels out in the market which are re-told from other characters POVs that completely disappoint. The kind where a reader like myself, pick up bubbling with excitement in hopes to reincarnate their favorite characters and stories, only for them to fall incredibly short. This was my worst fear with Worth The Fight- I may have even made the sign of the cross before starting. Well, I am giving my 100% guarantee that this does not fall short whatsoever. From the very beginning of this book, it transforms into something new. I was reading a completely never before told story and it figgin&#8217; blew me away!!! I kept having to look away from reading to run my fingers through my hair and ask myself, &#8220;what have you done with the Luke Kessler that bored me to death?!&#8221; The Luke Kessler in Worth The Fight is flawed and holy baby Jesus, I yearned for him. I loved sex on a stick, Luke, I lusted for his dirty and naughty ways, and I was fascinated with his ability to truly love. It amazed me how this author had completely reinvented an already versed character yet able to keep him true to the man she had introduced us to in the beginning of this series.Worth The Fight is rich with heartache for both Luke and Emmy and there were no shortages of stomach churning moments for me. I greatly empathized with the both of them- two people who craved to love and be loved. LD Davis also came heavily armed with the most libido inducing sex scenes I have ever come to encounter. None of which are forced or overtly perverse but wickedly delicious, it&#8217;s enough to make you moan along.As this is the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, I give thanks to LD Davis for having the brilliance to know that this third and final book to the AOP series was needed. I am proud to say that I have experienced a book that consisted of an already told story but ingeniously re-told in a completely different light. I have the closure I so greatly thirsted for in Worthy of Redemption and pleased to have found it through Luke Kessler&#8217;s hypnotizing and striking blue eyes.(For our Full Review: [...]",5.0

"Pitch Perfect is the first book in the new Boys of Summer series by Sierra Dean. This is the first book I have read of hers and it won't be the last. Ms. Dean has a writing style that captures the characters chemistry perfectly and lets the story consume your heart.Emmy's fought hard to achieve her dream job in a male oriented position. She knows she is going to have to go above and beyond normal standards to prove she is the best at what she does.Tucker is stepping back up to the plate after an injury benched him last season. He finds himself having to prove to the GM that he is worth keeping around. This is a new position for him. He has been the team star for years and isn't ready to have his career end yet.Tucker and Emmy need a year with no distractions. They both need to focus solely on what is at stake. However, with these two working so close together and their attraction for each other igniting, they have no chance at keeping a strictly professional relationship.I know this plot may sound similar to some, especially if you read many sports themed romance books, but I promise this one offers a unique and fresh story line. It is not a book driven by drama and angst. There really isn't even the typical conflict/resolve scenario. It's a heartwarming, beautiful, passionate love story that follows through an entire baseball season. It's clearly written by a true fan who not only knows how to write about a great sport, but succeeded to entwine a great romance into the mix. If you are looking for a lighthearted, funny, extremely sexy story grab this. I don't think you will be disappointed.Review copy provided for an honest review.",4.0
"I completely enjoyed this book!  Sally is a half-demon bounty hunter who decides she wants a minion.  Her best friend takes things one step further and turns her decision for a minion and superhero name into a reality show called Last Sidekick Standing.  Drake is a super-hot shifter who identifies Sally as his mate immediately and enters the competition so that no other men win.  Sally is spunky and funny and Drake is everything you want in a hero.  In some books when one character is super-entertaining the other ends up kind of boring in comparison, but not in this book!I have read a lot of Eve's books, and I have to say my only real complaint is that they seem so short!",5.0

"This really is a fantastic guide for anyone out there who is mildly to completely computer illiterate and has recently bought a new Kindle Fire HD. It covers all of the basic functions that a kindle can do (Skype, downloading books, transferring files, etc.). All of the instructions in it are clear cut and super easy to understand and it also has loads of images so that even a technophobic mother-in-law would get the gist of it. I certainly would suggest taking a look at this guide if you are have trouble with your Kindle Fire HD.",5.0

"I've read all SK's books and I haven't read one that I disliked.  SK is one of the few writers that I really look forward to each of her books. This book was also well balanced in suspense, drama, and romance with great characters.  Although, after finishing Sins and Betrayals I still had a few unanswered questions such as to the reason for Trinity dumping Ian without a second thought once he was sent to prison (maybe it due to his previous lifestyle, unclear to me).  Also, I'm assuming that Pillar, Josie, and Julius will have their own book since they also had some unanswered questions.  Overall, I thought the book was an excellent.",5.0
I had a hard time putting this one down.  It was a well written mystery/thriller that provided surprises one after another.  The characters were well developed and the plot contained the appropriate amount of tension to keep me reading.  Enthusiasts of this particular genre will enjoy &#34;Brainstorm&#34;.,5.0
Don't be fooled by the title or even the covers of these books. They don't do justice. Her stories take place during the medieval period for the most part although some I've read recently take place during the Regency period of the 1700s. She also wrote a Robin Hood series that is excellent.,5.0
"I loved this book and can hardly wait to dig into ROOTS AND WINGS, the third book in the series. Mr. Marchwell develops such wonderful characters you just don't want to leave them behind when a book ends. As a series, it's almost like memories that we love to go over again and again, to recall what happened next and how what looked like a terrible situation actually turned out well or at least all right in a different way.",4.0

"The story is just too uneven for me to give this one more than 3 stars (It's OK). The dialog and character interactions are also a bit on the weak side. Also, for me at least, the grand finale was pretty bad all around, both in concept and execution. If you are a fan of the genre, it's probably worth your time, just don't expect too much.",3.0

"Just walked in as we were headed to another area restaurant. Not only was I t
greeted by the hostess immediately, the manager came out from behind the bar and had a 10 minute conversation. They were actually in the process of closing yet they still offered me the menu! I didn't want to be the jerk who walks in at closing & makes everyone stay an hour later so I said I'd be back. They gave me the menu to home! The hostess & manager gave wonderful descriptions of their specialties & practically begged is to come back. Oh I'll be back!! Don't you worry about that. How can I possibly say no to people who are so kind & enthusiastic about what they do? Looking forward to a good meal!",5.0

"Every marriage goes through tough times. Think of the book as a refresher course for new and old marriages. As well this book offers solid advice on strengthening the bond of marriage. You will learn about loving yourself, respecting each other and showing one another just how special each is. You will learn how to resolve conflicts in you marriage as they are inevitable but most importantly how to get the love back. It does take a lot from the bible so its a great book for all Christian people. I recommend it to all who are facing a tough time with their relationship.",4.0

"So this Story is about Lumanite X a supernatural warrior who first started off as a Christian man named Noah Shields, who was a nobody, but then one day he gets attacked by evil forces that were trying to kill him, because they knew that he was the chosen one. They were especially trying to destroy his righteous humanity and make him into one of the reptilian race called Dynatose...Now the paranormal romance between Noah and his girlfriend in this story was fairly peachy, but good for people who love innocent paranormal romance instead of the more graphic  ones.Now I don't want to give away too much of the story, but it's very interesting and I need to tell you that it's worth reading, the way this Lumanite X got all his superpowers first from evil  and then from good was actually pretty cool... If you are a  Christian you may enjoy it even more because of the person that's in the story, that gave him most of his supernaturalpowers. If you are not a religious person, you may find some scenes annoying, but you never know, you may like it too, it all depends on your perspective, because there is a fine mixture between good and evil, both in the scientific realm and also in the religious realm.",5.0

"I thought this one was wonderfully written as Hunter's narration kept me captivated till the very end. Maybe some parts towards the end is over romantic but there is such a warm and good feeling with these two guys' love throughout the story that it is easily accepted. This may be Hunter's narration but it is so well written that Max's character is just as much alive. It is so easy to let these two boys get under my skin. I only realized there was a prequel,Boys of Summeron how they met and fell in love half way through the story. I wish I have known earlier but it did not prevent me from enjoying their love as the writer has done a marvelous job adequetely filling us in on how they got together. I enjoy the family drama thrown in as Max's father and sister give the guys such a tough time. Their reconciliation certainly add a tenderness and warmth to the whole story. Above all I love Max's sexual kinky side, which just ""up"" this romance for me. Certainly these two guys deserve the best of both worlds :). This is my first Cooper Davis' story and I am glad to add another M/M writer to my growing list of favorites. A great read.",5.0

"HONEY RED is the best m&eacute;nage story I have ever read.  Ms. Crowe crafted a powerful, emotional and heartwarming story of three people who struggle to accept the nature of their feelings for each other. All three of these characters are really well developed; each coming with their own wounds that are laid out for the reader with a beautifully detailed backstory.Nicholas Traynor is a Marine who has returned home wounded. I will not share all the details of his injury as I think it is more powerful if the reader uncovers them for themselves. I will say Ms Crowe's vivid and realistic portrayal of Nick's PTSD broke my heart and then with amazing storytelling rebuilt it again.Ian Donovan is a single Dad, whose journey to the man he is when Nick meets him is engaging.  Many of you know firsthand that having a child changes you. Ms. Crowe really illustrated that with Ian and his son.  The interactions with Jamie, Ian's son, were wonderful. There is a scene with macaroni and cheese that will make you chuckle out loud!Jamie's interactions with Nick and Hannah truly build in the story. They are funny, touching and they were so true to the observations of 4 year old little boy (oh the things kids say).Hannah Williams is a woman who worked hard to earn her MBA. She put her head down and made her way through school.  No men, no partying - just working hard to make something of herself.  Upon graduation she finds herself unable to find a ""real"" job so she accepts a Head of Marketing role with a local brewery company.  Her interview will have you laughing out loud. Hannah's evolution as she opens up to Ian and then Nick is endearing, lustful and so truly enjoyable to read.The secondary characters in the book truly added layers - Alyssa's concern for her brother, Nick; Gavin's interactions and banter with his twin brother, Ian; the ""characters"" involved with Nick's war wounds all added to the story.All of this helped create a world you will feel drawn into, one that will make you not want to put your book down.In true Liz fashion the sex scenes are beyond steamy, you can feel the chemistry between each of the characters. The scenes range from the portrayal of pure lust to tender lovemaking to needing to connect deeply with your lover.Ms Crowe keeps each scene unique and will make you want to turn the page. Please note the men in this book do touch each other - and yes it is hot.Keep your eyes out for the dog tags in the book cover; that scene one of the most powerful I have read in some time. It will make your heart pound. You may cry, then smile and in the end it will make you feel; which I think is the sign of a really well written book.In fitting with her mantra ""Romance for Real Life"", I truly enjoyed how this story kept it real, who's watching the kid, what will people think, how will this work, etc. She makes the characters address these things.I will NOT disclose anything about the catalysts and conflicts in this story. I will simply say that it is masterful.  Ms Crowe uses both the past and hopes for the present and it makes for truly engaging read.  I could not put this book down!The range of emotions when reading this book will astound you. You will laugh, you may even shed a tear but in the end it will leave you feeling happy that you took the time to curl up with this story and these characters.The Epilogue to this book was outstanding.  It will warm your heart and make you smile from ear to ear.Congratulations to Ms Crowe, this book should be a benchmark to which all m&eacute;nage reads are judged.Reviewed by Denisefor The Romance Reviews",5.0
I got my Kidle from Best Buy an their protection plan was to high an we read the fien print printable it did not cover cracked screens. Knowing my talent at dropping items with screens even with covers on them I needed coverage that would cover cracked screens. My husband found Square Trade an we read all of the fine print an it said they covered cracked screens so I purchased it and low and be hold about 2 months later sitting on the back porch my Kindle met with the concrete. I called them up they said no problem and in 3 days I had my new Kindle in hand with out one problem. I am going to recommend this to everyone I know that had a tablet.,5.0

"It is difficult with the advent of self-published and small press books to separate good quality from poor. Often it is a matter of poor or no editing and that is the problem with this book.  Had there been an editor or at the least a good beta reader many of the word problems and punctuation errors would have been caught.But the real problem for this reader (I've been a Scottish/romance reader for over 40 years) is the lack of development of the story. The characters do not act or react as one might expect in a romance, and there is just no sexual tension to speak of (fighting each other and accidentally falling on each other is not sexual tension). So that when they do succumb to each other it is just not believable and lasts but two or three purple prose paragraphs. This might have been better executed if they just done ""it""  behind closed doors, because as written it was very anticlimactic (no pun intended). The story drags with too many characters that seem to have no real purpose in moving the story along, which makes the pace of the story very slow and the reader loses interest in caring what happens to this couple. I kept wondering when the real story was to begin. Sorry, for me it just never did.Finally, historically it was just too bland, and lacking real knowledge of Scotland. It could have taken place in England and who would have known the difference. There were a number of historical inaccuracies that wouldn't have plagued this reader if there had been a purpose to the change, but this appears as filler or poorly executed foreshadowing for future books, despite the author's acknowledged experience.  As a Scottish historian and researcher I just didn't buy much of the premise for this story set in Scotland. Though I wil say she did pretty good with the dialogue, though the hero's Scottish dialect seemed to wane near the end of the story.Too harsh a review for a 99 read, you say? Maybe, but if self-published authors want to be taken seriously then the products they offer must meet a minimum of publishing standards which at the very least should be a copy free of grammatical errors. Was it worth the cost of the book?  For me, not really.",2.0
"I have been dabbling with the concept of getting my internal system to be more alkaline but I didn't really know why it was better for me or what I needed to do.  This book clearly outlines what the whole concept means and provides easy steps for how to go about achieving it.I learned so many interesting and useful tidbits of information. For one thing I didn't know that rice and pasta were acid forming foods. For another I didn't know some acidity, especially in the stomach, is necessary in order for food to be broken down and assimilated. I thought the goal was 100% alkalinity, but the author Jake Hargis, explains otherwise.  He also says stress contributes to acidity, which makes so much sense. The book also gives you specific markers on how to spot how alkalinity has manifested in your body.Finally there are simple actionable steps you can take to remedy the situation. What I love is that Hargis doesn't recommend going cold turkey and eliminating everything, but rather advises one to cut back slowly on acidic foods while incorporating healthier habits.  This was an easy read packed full of useful information.",5.0

"Early on it is clear that Janine, the heroine in Hot Gossip, has a dark past she&#8217;s trying to escape and is doing this by living a hermit&#8217;s existence in rural Ireland. As her past dribbles out the main story conflict comes into sharper focus as the reader starts to ask a few questions. Will she be able to avoid her ex-husband and his minions (putting that failed relationship behind her isn&#8217;t as easy as she&#8217;d like)? What happened to Jake, who Janine had fallen in love with before his death, and will she be able to move past her memory of her almost-too-good-to-believe memories of their romance to find love again? And if she does, will it be with Mick, the handsome single father with a dark past of his own, or Brian, the friend who would obviously be interested in more?All of these questions and working toward the answers combine into a solid story. However, it is another storyline, Janine&#8217;s relationship with Mick&#8217;s daughter, Nelia, that I found the most interesting and, in many ways, their interactions drove the rest of the story.**Originally written for &#34;Books and Pals&#34; book blog.

"I'd love to feel better about coming for a meal someday because we hear good things about the food, but I can't get out of my head my first experience going in there. A year or 2 ago  I simply came in to locate a menu to either look at or to take home.  I looked around to locate the menu and saw 5-6 pretty female employees standing over to my left.  They were not far from me.  They continued to talk during this time.  Not ONE of them looked up at me, and no one from there or anywhere came forward to welcome me, or ask what they could do for me or if I would be eating.  I felt uncomfortable.  It was NOT crowded.  Is this an overly picky criticism?   I really don't think so.  To me it spoke in volumes a non customer service attitude. Thank you for reading this comment.",2.0
"The riddle chest is simply a book of riddles. They are all definitely well thought out ones and will give you something interesting to try to figure out. There's a few rather simple ones, but some are quite difficult.The book also doesn't have the answers to the riddles right after the riddle itself (which is something I usually run into with riddle books) It was a lot nicer this way since I couldn't accidentally see the answer before even having a chance to figure it out for myself. The answers do come in two ways, one is coded so you can't see the answer if you happen not to want to and then after that it gives them all in a list. (Of course that does mean having to flip back and forth to see the riddle and then the answer.)Overall it was a nice brainteaser and if you are a riddle fan you definitely shouldn't be disappointed!",5.0
